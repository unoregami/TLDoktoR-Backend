In early 1972, a probe known as
Pioneer 10 was launched into space
on a mission to the largest
planet in the Solar System.
After millennia of
speculation and wonder,
humanity got its first
close-up view of Jupiter.
Accelerated by the
immense gravity of the planet,
Pioneer 10 was then
catapulted into deep space,
destined to leave the Solar System
and roam the galaxy for billions of years.
On the off-chance that this
vestige of humanity
should one day be intercepted
by an alien intelligence,
it was affixed with a message.
A message designed to answer
three central questions.
[Carl Sagan]
Where we are, when we are, and who we are.
More than half a century
has now passed
since the launch of our
first galactic emissary,
and in that time, we've made numerous
attempts to communicate with life beyond.
Either by attaching greeting cards
to probes headed for interstellar space
or by targeting our cosmic neighbors
with high-powered beams of light.
So far, humanity's been left on read,
but that could change at any moment.
As long as we keep making noise,
there's always a chance we'll be heard.
An exceedingly slim chance, as we'll see,
but a non-zero chance nonetheless.
Given the paradigm-shifting potential
of contacting beings from another world,
it sure would be nice to know what exactly
we've been telling them all these years.
I mean, don't get me wrong,
"Where we are, when we are,
and who we are",
sounds really neat and all,
but it's not exactly rich in detail.
So let's start with
that plaque on Pioneer 10.
What does it say,
and more importantly,
to whom should I direct my anger when
the aliens arrive to harvest my bones?
The idea to attach
a nmessage to Pioneer 10
was the brainchild of journalist
and author Eric Burgess.
Less than four months before
the probe was scheduled to launch,
Burgess approached famed astronomer
and science communicator Carl Sagan,
who, in turn, relayed
the proposal to NASA.
Sagan was given three
weeks to devise the message,
and with the help of
his wife and artist Linda
as well as fellow
astronomer Frank Drake,
they scrambled together
a series of pictograms
etched into a gold-laden
plate of aluminum.
In the words of Sagan...
Near the upper-left corner,
we find a diagram of hydrogen,
the simplest and most abundant
element in the universe.
One electron
bound to a proton.
More specifically, the diagram
depicts a single atom of hydrogen
transitioning from one
energy state to another,
which is meant to be conveyed by this
horizontal line here in the middle.
This shift in energy is known
as a hyperfine transition,
and it's accompanied
by the emission of a radio wave.
That radio wave has
a very specific frequency
that's so prominent across the universe
that we've given it a name,
the hydrogen line.
Something that beings
of sufficient intelligence
to capture a
drifting spacecraft
would no doubt
be aware of as well.
In human terms, it has a frequency
of about 1420 megahertz
which means that each cycle of the wave
has a period of about 0.7 nanoseconds
and a corresponding length
of roughly 21 centimeters.
The recipients would obviously
express their measurements
using something other than
nanoseconds and centimeters,
but what's important here is that
they're measuring the same thing
and that that thing
never changes.
The duration of one wavecycle and
the distance covered during that cycle
remains the same
across the universe.
This allows us to establish a
shared unit of both time and length.
We're basically telling the
aliens to treat their measurement
of the hyperfine transition
of neutral hydrogen
as one unit of time
and one unit of length.
That's why there's a vertical
line here in the middle,
which is meant to convey
the concept of one in binary.
But, of course, hydrogen
is merely one of many
possible interpretations
of this diagram.
The aliens could just as easily
think it's some sort of language,
technology, star system,
or literally anything else.
To help them narrow down the list, the
plaque includes three outlined silhouettes
of a man, a woman,
and Pioneer 10.
These illustrations
were drawn to scale,
so the aliens can use the
spacecraft's diameter
as a basis for deriving the height
of the two figures in the foreground.
In human terms, that would make
the man approximately 182 centimeters
and the woman about 169.
The woman's height has
been further emphasized
by two demarcation marks
along the right edge here.
Between them is a sequence of four lines
representing the number eight in binary.
The purpose of this number
is to communicate to the aliens
that the woman is eight times as tall
as the wavelength of the hydrogen line.
In human terms,
that's about 169,
just like the woman's height
relative to the probe's diameter.
In other words, the interpretation
of this as a schematic of hydrogen
and the interpretation of this
as an outline of the spacecraft
are mutually corroborative.
They provide the aliens with a means
of deriving the height of this figure
on the basis of two
distinct measurements,
which should help them narrow
down the list of possible interpretations.
At least, that was the idea.
But when you actually measure
the height of the couple
relative to this
sketch of the probe,
you quickly realize they're
about 10 centimeters too tall.
While I have no way of confirming this,
I suspect the source of this discrepancy
is that the reflector dish on
Pioneer 10 is not a perfect circle.
It's slightly wider in this
dimension than in this one,
known as a major
and minor axis.
If we assume that this
outline of the probe
is oriented with the minor
axis along the vertical,
the relative height of the couple
is indeed what you'd expect.
But if that is what the
Sagans and Drake intended,
only two of the three antenna struts
should be visible here in the front.
The fact that all three have
been drawn on the plaque,
implies the probe is oriented with
the major axis along the vertical,
thereby increasing the couples'
height by roughly 10 centimeters.
Nevertheless, it's hardly surprising for
an oversight like this to go unnoticed
given they only had three weeks
to assemble everything,
and Sagan acknowledged
they could have done a better job
had they not been
so pressed for time.
Moving on to the
left side of the plaque,
we find a starburst pattern of 15 straight
lines emanating from a central point.
This is a galactic
map of pulsars
that's meant to help the aliens
pinpoint the Solar System.
Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron
stars that can easily be spotted
from thousands or even
millions of lightyears away.
They're often described
as cosmic clocks or
lighthouses because they're
not only extremely bright
but pulsate at very
consistent rates.
This red line shooting
off to the right
represents the distance between the Sun
and the center of the galaxy,
while the green lines
represent the relative distance
between the Sun and 14 pulsars.
To make it easier to
identify the pulsars,
each line is accompanied by the star's
rotation period expressed in binary,
marked here in blue.
Take this one,
for instance.
This star is known as the Vela Pulsar,
and it's about 1 000 lightyears from Earth.
Its rotation period has been expressed
in waveperiods of the hydrogen line
and reads 126 726 823 when
translated from binary to decimal.
What that means is that
it takes the Vela Pulsar
almost 127 million times
longer to complete one rotation
than the waveperiod of a hydrogen
atom undergoing hyperfine transition.
In human terms, that's about
89 million nanoseconds or
eleven rotations every second,
which is about this fast.
By scouring the
galaxy for pulsars
that match the information
embedded within this map,
the aliens could theoretically
triangulate the Solar System.
In fact, the chart not only discloses
our location in space but also in time.
As Sagan put it...
[Carl Sagan]
Where we are, when we are, and who we are.
This goes back to the
cosmic clock analogy
because pulsars gradually wind
down at highly predictable rates.
So even though the Vela Pulsar
will have a much slower rate of spin
by the time it's observed
by our hypothetical aliens,
they could simply wind back
the clock until its rotation period
matched the one
etched into the plaque.
Repeating that process for
at least some of the other pulsars
would enable them to figure
out not just from where,
but also when Pioneer 10
was launched.
At least, that was the idea.
But when the plaque
was created,
the existence of pulsars had only
been known for about four years.
Astronomers have since
learned a lot more about them,
and they're not nearly as rare, stable,
and long-lived as once believed.
They can only be observed from
very specific vantage points, and
unpredictable speedups,
slowdowns, and glitches
challenge the
cosmic clock analogy.
Sagan and Drake were
aware of at least
some of these issues, but there
was only so much they could've foreseen
with the limited data
available at the time.
In fact, there was
such great uncertainty
regarding the distance of
some of the featured pulsars
that they added these
breaks in the lines,
indicating they're based on rough
estimates rather than exact figures.
Finally, on the
bottom of the plaque,
we find a plain schematic
of the Solar System.
These binary numbers represent
the orbital distance of each planet
expressed as multiples of one tenth of the
mean distance between the Sun and Mercury.
For instance, the number above
Earth reads 26 in decimal,
which means it is
26 times further away
than 10% of the distance
between the Sun and Mercury.
The obvious problem
with this approach
is that it requires the recipients to
already be familiar with the Solar System.
Otherwise, one tenth of the distance
between the Sun and Mercury
is completely meaningless.
We might as well have expected them
to be familiar with kilometers or miles.
To quote the creators of the plaque...
It's unclear why the
Sagans and Drake
knowingly used an
indecipherable unit of length
when they had already gone through the
trouble of creating a universal yardstick
with this schematic of hydrogen.
My best guess is that the wavelength
of a state-shifting hydrogen atom
was simply too small a unit to
represent interplanetary distances,
and the resulting binary strings became
too long to neatly fit on the plaque.
Again, they only had three
weeks to do all of this.
Last but not least, the trajectory of the
spacecraft has been traced with an arrow,
and the probe's main antenna
is pointing at home.
Over half a century later,
Pioneer 10 is now more than
20 billion kilometers from the Sun.
That might sound like a lot, especially
given how I just emphasized that number,
but it's only about three
times further away than Pluto,
and it takes less than a day for a
light beam to cover the same distance.
Even though it's darting through
space at several kilometers per second,
the probe won't surpass even
the nearest star to the Sun
for many tens of
thousands of years.
But it gets worse because Pioneer 10
is not headed for any particular star.
It's expected to pass within a few trillion
kilometers of a relatively nearby system
in about 90 000 years or so
when this star, all the way out here,
will come closer to the Sun
than Proxima Centauri is today.
While an exoplanet has yet
to be detected around this star,
if one does exist, and that planet
just so happens to be inhabited
by intelligent beings in possession of
technology that allows them to detect a
perfectly silent and practically invisible
speck gently gliding by their system
at a distance greater than
a thousand times the orbit of Pluto,
then, yeah...
...maybe they'll see it.
A nearly identical probe was launched
in 1973 known as Pioneer 11,
and it was outfitted with the exact
same plaque as Pioneer 10.
Much like its predecessor, Pioneer 11
was just kind of hurtled into deep space
with no particular
target in mind.
While a chance encounter with another
planetary system is not impossible,
even across timescales
of many billions of years,
Sagan and Drake believed
it was more likely
for the probes to be
scooped up by an alien spaceship
traveling between the stars.
Some studies have shown
that space is, in fact,
a tiny bit big.
It's very easy to criticize
the Pioneer Plaques.
Any message designed to be understood by
beings of which we know nothing about will
unavoidably rely upon assumptions
that could easily be false.
Will the aliens understand
the meaning of an arrow?
Will they comprehend
binary notation?
Will they even grasp the concept
of conveying information
using two-dimensional pictograms?
While questions like
these are perfectly valid,
they're ultimately quite pointless
because the answer is always the same.
We don't know.
We don't know what the aliens look like,
how they think, or even if they exist.
The plaque could be so at odds with
how they perceive and navigate the universe
they fail to even
recognize it as a message
or we might be foolish for thinking
a civilization so technologically advanced
they're able to locate and retrieve a
derelict spacecraft from the dead of space
will be stumped by an
interstellar cave painting.
While many believe the
recipients will be nothing like us,
we could just as easily
have a lot in common.
After all, we share
the same universe
and are therefore shaped and bound
by the same physical laws of nature.
In fact, that's what
some people fear the most.
That the aliens
could be just like us.
That they could inflict upon us what we
inflict upon members of our own species.
The Sagans and Drake tried
to get ahead of these concerns
by emphasizing the
improbability of interception.
They stressed that, even if the
probes were to fall into the tentacles
of a hostile intelligence
in some distant future,
they'd be too far
away to pose a threat.
But statistics and
probability only get you so far
because fear is a
powerful emotion.
[George Wald]
And may I say so that we can have a
somewhat warmer and livelier
conversation as this meeting goes on.
I can conceive of no nightmare as terrifying
as establishing such communication
with a so-called superior or, if you wish,
advanced technology in outer space.
A year after the launch of Pioneer 11,
the Arecibo Radio Observatory,
located deep within the jungles of
Puerto Rico, received a major facelift.
The telescope was not only resurfaced
to greatly increase its sensitivity,
but also outfitted with
a powerful transmitter.
As it happens, the man in charge of the
research center overseeing the facility
was none other
than Frank Drake.
To celebrate the telescope's
upgraded capabilities,
Drake's assistant,
Jane Allen,
suggested they transmit
an interstellar message
during the upcoming
rededication ceremony.
Unlike the tangible
Pioneer Plaques,
the Arecibo Message had to be
communicated using invisible radio waves.
Drake had previously
experimented with the idea
of transmitting an
image coded in binary,
and with the help of some colleagues and
graduate students, he came up with this.
Now, this may not look like much,
but if we fill in all the
zeros with black squares
and all the ones
with white squares,
a highly pixelated
image will emerge.
I'll explain the different
parts in just a moment,
but first, it's important to
understand how an image like this
is converted
into radio waves.
It starts with a grid that, in this case,
is 23 columns wide and 73 rows tall
for a total of 1 679 cells.
We then fill in the cells
needed to create the image.
Because the image is composed
of only two shades, black and white,
that means it's binary,
and each cell can also be described
as a binary digit, or bit for short.
By convention, binary code is
expressed using zeros and ones,
but it works just as well with two
different shapes, two different colors,
two different rocks, or literally any
combination of two contrasting values.
In fact, that's why binary code
is so frequently used
to write interstellar messages.
It's not because aliens are
guaranteed to understand it.
No, it's simply one of the
least complicated methods
of conveying information
that we can imagine.
Chinese is composed of
thousands of characters,
English has 26 letters,
while decimal demands
10 unique numerals.
Binary only requires two.
Not two letters, not two symbols, literally
just two of something, which we call bits.
For instance, instead of
black and white squares,
we could just as easily express this
bitmap using two different frequencies.
If a cell is black,
that's one frequency.
If it's white,
that's another.
There you go.
That's all there's to it.
This long sequence of two
flip-flopping frequencies
can now be transmitted
using a radio telescope.
When that signal is picked
up by an alien astronomer,
they may find it difficult to ascribe such
an unnatural pattern to a natural source.
This will hopefully draw attention to the
number of frequency fluctuations because
1 679 is what's
known as a semiprime.
It's disappointingly not the
half-brother of Optimus Prime,
but rather the product of
precisely two prime numbers.
In this case, those
prime numbers are 23 and 73,
which happens to be the
dimensions of the original grid.
If the aliens were to plot the
frequencies onto a grid of that size
and fill in all the cells
occupied by one of the values,
they would uncover the image.
As for the contents
of the message,
it starts off easy enough with the
numbers 1 through 10 expressed in binary
and written from right-to-left.
So 0-0-1, 0-1-0, 0-1-1,
and so on.
Moving on to this large cluster of pixels,
we find a bunch of binary formulations for
the building blocks of life as we know it.
It starts with the atomic numbers
of five basic elements:
hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen,
oxygen, and phosphorus.
These numbers are then used to
describe essential components of DNA.
For instance, a carbon
atom has six protons,
which means it has an
atomic number of six.
0-1-1-0 is binary for decimal 6.
Because carbon is in the
second column from the right,
it means the second column
of these molecules underneath
indicates how many
carbon atoms they contain.
So these four represent an organic
compound known as deoxyribose,
which has five carbon atoms,
and 1-0-1 is binary for decimal 5.
In the center of the image, we find a
crude rendition of the DNA double helix
enclosing a
large binary value
denoting the number of nucleotide
base pairs in the human genome.
In simpler terms, it's a way
of expressing the complexity or
size of our genetic makeup.
However, more recent measurements have
since reduced that number by over a billion,
so this figure is no longer accurate.
A bit further down, we find
a simple sketch of a human,
alongside an expression
of their height on the right
and the estimated global
population in 1974 on the left.
Directly underneath the human is
a schematic of the Solar System,
followed by an illustration
of the Arecibo Telescope.
Now, you might be wondering,
"How the hell were the aliens
supposed to understand any of that?"
The simple answer is,
they weren't really.
Unlike the Pioneer Plaques'
commendable attempt
to establish some sort of common ground
using shared units of measurement
and a galactic map of pulsars,
the Arecibo Message was much
more of a publicity stunt.
For instance, the
length of the message
was largely determined by
the presumed attention span
of those invited to the
rededication ceremony.
The concern was that,
if the message was too long,
attendees might be annoyed
by the sound of the transmission,
which was planned to be broadcast
over loudspeakers at the event.
In the end, the message was
constrained to about three minutes
to mitigate the risk
of a dull afternoon.
Likewise, the selection of a target for
the transmission was entirely dictated
by what happened to be visible
in the sky during the ceremony.
Drake ultimately selected a bright
cluster of stars known as Messier 13,
which is about
24 000 lightyears from Earth.
While this meant the message would
take 24 000 years to reach its destination,
the density of M13 also meant
the signal could sweep over many
thousands of stars upon arrival.
At the time, this was thought to maximize
the odds of the transmission being received,
and Carl Sagan
even told a reporter
that he believed there was a 50% chance
that M13 was home to an alien civilization.
But as it turns out, more stars
does not necessarily mean
more opportunities for life.
Not only are globular clusters like M13
typically starved of heavier elements
essential for planetary formation,
but the proximity of the stars makes it
challenging for any planets that do form
to maintain stable orbits.
Considering it took billions of years
before humans evolved on Earth,
a region as densely
packed and chaotic as M13
is probably not the most conducive
environment for life as we know it.
While there is some optimism
that small planets like Earth
could survive in very tight orbits,
out of six thousand exoplanets
discovered to date,
only two are located
within a globuluster.
Nevertheless, on
November 16, 1974,
a small crowd of astronomers,
dignitaries, and others
bopped along to a three-minute
concert of two warbling tones
as humanity's first interstellar
radiotelegram was beamed into space.
A common misconception
about the Arecibo Message
is that it will miss its target because the
telescope was aimed at the position of M13
at the time of transmission, rather than
where it will be in 24 000 years.
In reality, when Drake crunched
the numbers back in 1974,
he realized that the cluster was
so enormous and slow-moving
that even if they aimed the
telescope at its location at the time,
the message would simply strike slightly
off-center rather than a bullseye.
Presuming against all odds that M13
is home to an alien civilization
in possession of an extremely sensitive
instrument that's not only designed
to pick up radio waves at the
exact same frequency and bandwidth
at which the Arecibo Message
was transmitted,
but also pointed squarely at the
Solar System at just the right time,
Messierian astronomers will
have a non-zero chance
to detect a non-repeating burst of energy
lasting for less than three minutes
some 24 000 years from now.
Even though they're unlikely
to decode the message,
they might still suspect it's
an attempt at communication.
It's a bit like,
even if you don't speak Swedish...
*SWEDISH NOISES*
If they suspect it's a transmission
from another civilization,
the aliens may
choose to respond.
Presuming there's no way
to overcome the speed of light,
such a response would obviously
take just as long to reach us
as it took the Arecibo Message
to reach them.
Based on the most recent measurements of
the distance between the Solar System and M13,
the earliest possible date
we can expect a reply
is the year 50370.
Don't forget to mark your calendars.
There are even more
hopelessly optimistic scenarios,
like a star or spaceship crossing paths
with the signal somewhere along the way.
But the odds of that happening
are so vanishingly small
it might as well
be impossible.
Not least of all because,
as you can see,
M13 is actually floating far
above the galactic disc,
and there's a whole lot
of nothing in between.
But, once again, these
astronomical improbabilities
were not enough to allay
concerns of an alien invasion.
A prominent radio astronomer in
Britain at the time, Sir Martin Ryle,
feared the Arecibo Message might
attract a more advanced civilization
seeking to colonize the Earth
and mine its resources.
He took issue with the fact that a small
group of people had transmitted a message
that could endanger
all of humanity,
and called for an international discussion
in advance of any future transmissions.
While these concerns largely
fell on deaf ears at the time,
Ryle was far from the
only one urging caution.
By the mid-1970s, NASA was
gearing up to launch two spacecraft
known as Voyager 1 and 2.
Much like the Pioneer
probes before them,
the Voyager twins would be slingshot
into deep space by granddaddy Jupiter
on their way to explore
the outer Solar System.
Due to the similarity
between the two programs
and the public interest
generated by the Pioneer Plaques,
NASA engineer John Casani
thought a similar message
ought to be carried
by the Voyagers.
When Casani reached out
to Carl Sagan in late 1976,
he jumped at the chance to
scribe another cosmic postcard.
But this time, he wanted to impress upon
the recipients not just how we think,
but also how we feel.
After consulting numerous
people on how to proceed,
two propositions stood above
the rest: music and pictures.
Sagan was partial to music while
fellow astronomer Frank Drake
thought nothing could capture the human
condition like a series of photographs.
After some additional brainstorming,
it was Drake who finally realized
they could accommodate both ideas
using a phonograph record.
A phonograph record is an
analog storage medium,
primarily used to record
and replay sound.
To record, you simply press a needle against
the surface of a slow-spinning disc.
By generating a sound,
like strumming a guitar...
...the needle will start to
vibrate as it carves a thin
undulating groove
into the disc.
To replay the sound, you
simply create a copy of the disc
using a less
malleable material,
place the needle back at
the beginning of the groove,
and spin the disc
back up again.
As the needle
collides with the
hundreds of microscopic
indentations in the groove,
it generates the same
vibrations used to create it.
When those vibrations reach your ears,
you'll hear a guitar being strummed.
The process is a bit more
complicated in practice, of course,
but honestly,
not by much.
Whether it's a single
vibrating guitar string
or the deafening crescendo
of an entire orchestra,
all of it can be recorded and
replayed by tiny bumps in a grove.
Yes, magic is real,
and this is it.
But what about the photographs?
How do you get visual information
onto a storage medium made for sound?
It's surprisingly simple, actually.
Remember how the
Arecibo Message painted a picture
by treating black and white
squares as two different frequencies?
I mean, it would be
a bit concerning if you don't.
That was just 12 minutes ago.
You better get that checked out.
Anyway, they basically did that,
but instead of just two frequencies,
they used a whole range of them.
Take a gradient
like this, for instance.
If we assign a low
frequency to black...
...and a high frequency to white...
...then every shade
of gray in between
will be mapped to a
corresponding frequency of sound.
With that translation
scheme in mind,
converting an entire
photograph becomes trivial.
For instance, this is a black-and-white image
of Mercury that's actually on the record.
All we have to do is scan
every pixel in this image,
one by one,
column by column,
and translate every shade of gray
into its audible equivalent.
Once we've translated every frequency
of light into a frequency of sound,
we end up with a brief
sample of incoherent noise
that acts like an acoustic
fingerprint of the image.
Again, I'm simplifying a lot here, and
the actual process used analog signals
rather than quantized pixel values, but it
gives you a rough idea of how it was done.
Some photographs were actually
recorded three times in a row
using filters for
red, green, and blue.
 When recombined
in just the right way,
they produce an image
full of vibrant colors,
even though, individually,
they're all black and white.
Again, magic is real.
In an effort to save
space, they also recorded
two simultaneous streams
of images into the same groove.
This was accomplished by using
the side-to-side motion of the needle
to record one stream,
and the up-and-down motion
to record another.
The end result was this echoey stereo sound
of two image streams playing at once.
To provide the aliens with
the best possible chance
of decoding this cryptic disc
of gold-plated copper,
the record's aluminum cover was
engraved with some basic instructions.
First of all, the pulsar
map makes a return,
and so, too, does the diagram showing the
hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen.
The latter of which is,
once again, used to establish
a shared unit of
both time and length.
Near the top left, we find
an overhead view of the record
circumscribed by a binary number.
It's telling the aliens to spin the
record about five billion times faster
than the hyperfine
transition period.
In human terms, that's equivalent
to roughly one rotation every 3.6 seconds.
To ensure the aliens have something
with which to play the record,
a ceramic cartridge holding
a diamond-tipped needle
was attached to the
mounting bracket.
An outline of this cartridge has also
been drawn along the right edge here
to indicate the playback
starting position.
Underneath the overhead view,
there's also a side view,
accompanied by
another binary number.
This time, it's telling the aliens
how long it takes to play
one full side of the record,
which is about 54 minutes.
Moving on to the top right,
we find a step-by-step guide
for decoding the images.
The waveform at the very top
corresponds to three vertical slices
of the record's first image,
while the zigzag
pattern underneath
means the slices are meant to be stacked
side-by-side, one after the other.
As we already know, this angelic
symphony of beeps and buzzings
are mapped to
different shades of gray
according to a very specific
translation scheme.
A scheme the aliens are
meant to reverse engineer
with the help of
these binary numbers.
There are three slices
labeled 1, 2, 3,
and each one corresponds to
roughly 8 milliseconds of audio.
A full image is 512 slices wide
and should form a rectangular
shape with a 4:3 aspect ratio.
Simple as that.
On the off-chance that the
aliens should somehow be
confused by these
crystal clear instructions,
the record's first image has also
been outlined here at the bottom
to show them what it's supposed to
look like when properly decoded.
In fact, this calibration circle
is the very first piece of data
the aliens would
find on the record.
It's followed by more than a hundred
images, starting with some basic math,
units of measurement, and a
speedrun of the human experience.
The sequence ends with this image of a violin
floating above a page of musical notation.
It shows the beginning of a somber
classical piece known as Cavatina,
and once the image fades, legendary emcee
Ludwig van Beethoven kicks off the mixtape.
But the minutes-long performance
of Cavatina only plays for a few seconds
before it's interrupted by
even more beeps and buzzings.
You see, six additional images
were squeezed onto the
record at the very last moment,
including a written statement by then
President of the United States, Jimmy Carter,
and a tedious listing of nearly
a hundred members of Congress.
This bureaucratic theme
then segues back into audio
with a speech by then Secretary General
of the United Nations, Kurt Waldheim.
The aliens will then be treated
to a series of greetings
spoken in
58 different languages.
This is followed by various sounds of things
like weather, animals, and technology
before the record ends with a playlist
of nearly 90 minutes of music
covering a vast array of
instruments, styles, and cultures.
It starts about halfway
through the A side of the record
with an uplifting
composition by Johann Bach.
After another nine tracks, including
a famous American rock single and
many obscure folk songs
from around the world,
the music picks up again on the record's
B side with another banger by Johann Bach.
After nearly an hour's worth of
additional music from countries like
Germany, Peru, Russia, China,
and India, just to name a few,
the Golden Record comes to a somnific end
with a full rendition of Beethoven's Cavatina
Nearly half a century later,
Voyager 1 is now the most
distant spacecraft ever launched.
Even though it was preceded by
the Pioneer probes by several years
and even its own
twin by two weeks,
Voyager 1 attained a greater escape
velocity and has since overtaken them all.
Amazingly, both Voyagers
are still transmitting to this day,
although they're fast approaching
their operational limits.
Once they go offline
and fall out of range,
they'll join their
pioneering brethren
in a timeless and destinationless
trek between the stars.
Because the interstellar medium is sparsely
populated with tiny dust particles,
the exposed surfaces of
both the Pioneer Plaques
and the Golden Records
will erode over time.
While the former is somewhat
protected by its inward-facing placement,
it's still exposed to
the vacuum of space.
On the other hand,
the Golden Records are
firmly pressed up against
the body of the spacecraft.
According to one estimate,
the outward-facing B side
could survive for at least
a few billion years,
whereas the lifespan of the
concealed A side is anyone's guess.
It's not impossible that many tens or even
hundreds of billions of years from now,
all the photographs, greetings, and one
third of the music will still be intact.
While the response to the Golden Records
was overwhelmingly positive,
they did nonetheless
receive a bit of criticism.
Much like before, some people
were completely undeterred
by the near-impossibility
of interception
and feared the Voyagers might
attract a hostile intelligence.
Others focused more on
the contents of the message
because they felt it was disingenuous
to paint humanity in such a positive light
when war, crime,
and cruelty
are as much a part of the human condition
as music, sports, and science.
As one of the makers of the record, Jon
Lomberg, so succinctly points out...
The decision to exclude the
uglier sides of humanity was
partly to avoid potential backlash
from people here on Earth,
but also an attempt to make us seem
less hostile to any future recipients.
While a mushroom
cloud does convey a
shameful yet significant
part of who we are,
it could also be
perceived as a threat.
On the other hand, the
exclusion of such imagery
could, by itself,
be quite revealing
as we expose our casual
willingness to deceive
through tactful omission.
Dating profiles, job interviews,
meeting someone for the first time.
I don't know if this is what the
Golden Records team had in mind, but
being selective with the truth
to make a good first impression,
how terribly
human of them.
The three initiatives
mentioned so far
are likely to be the only
ones you've heard of before.
The Pioneer Plaques, the Arecibo Message,
and especially the Golden Records
generated immense public interest at the
time and remain well known to this day.
But our attempts to
communicate with life beyond
did not end with
the Golden Records.
In fact, just a few years later,
the silence was broken yet again,
and this time,
the target was so close,
the minimum response time
was measured not in eons
but decades.
In early 1983, Japanese
publishing company Shueisha
was looking for ways to
commemorate the 15th anniversary
of their most popular
manga anthology magazine,
known as
Weekly Shōnen Jump.
Due to the recent success of
the film E.T. by Steven Spielberg,
and the fact that 1983 had been
declared the World Communications Year
by the United Nations,
they decided to launch a
competition dubbed Call to the Cosmos.
The price was a trip
across the Pacific
to visit a large radio telescope
in Stanford, California,
from which a message
would be transmitted
to a nearby star system.
To win, all you had to do was submit a
proposal for what the message should say.
With a readership in the millions,
the magazine received
nearly 50 000 message ideas
from children across the country.
These were then compiled into
one abbreviated message,
and 15 lucky winners were
selected to tag along on the trip.
For the selection of
a transmission target,
the organizers turned
to two radio astronomers
named Masaki Morimoto
and Hisashi Hirabayashi.
They eventually
chose the star Altair
because it's very bright
and relatively close.
It was also selected because the
message was planned to be transmitted
during an annual Japanese
festival known as Tanabata
which celebrates the meeting
of two celestial deities
represented by the
stars Vega and Altair.
Furthermore, Morimoto and Hirabayashi
were asked to create their own message,
and after three days of work,
they came up with this.
A sequence of 13 bitmaps
measuring 71x71 pixels
that were clearly inspired
by the Arecibo Message.
The first four images depict
things like natural numbers,
prime numbers, basic math,
common elements,
the Solar System,
and essential
building blocks of DNA.
The next eight illustrate
the evolution of life
from simple organisms
to jellyfish,
fish,
amphibians,
dinosaurs,
apparently not Bigfoot,
a family of humans,
and a close-up
of a woman's face.
The final bitmap
depicts a crude illustration
of the Stanford radio telescope
alongside information like its radius,
wavelength of the transmission,
and total number of
bits in the message.
We also find the word "TOAST"
written in plain English.
According to Hirabayashi,
during the three-day stint
when he and Morimoto
conceived of these images,
they weren't necessarily
sober the whole way through.
This may or may not have
influenced their decision to include
the Japanese and English
word for "TOAST"
equated to the chemical
formula for ethanol.
Because Weekly Shōnen Jump
targets a very young demographic,
the magazine tried
to clean this up a bit
by reframing what was
clearly an afterthought
by two half-drunk
astronomers as...
Nevertheless, for about
an hour on August 15, 1983,
the 13 bitmaps and an audio recording
of the abridged fan-submitted greetings
 were beamed towards Altair.
Altair is among the brightest
stars in the night sky,
and at a distance of
less than 17 lightyears,
it's only, what, a few quadrillion
stone throws away?
In fact, Altair is so cosmically close
that enough time has now passed
for the transmission to
have made a full round trip.
That is to say, the message reached
Altair back around the millennium shift,
and we could have received
a reply as early as 2017.
Now, the fact that we never did does not
necessarily mean there's nobody home.
Perhaps they missed
the brief 60-minute window
when the message
swept across their system?
Perhaps they did pick it up, but
they're still drafting a response?
Perhaps they took one quick look at
Earth and humanity, and were like...
While all of these scenarios
are, of course, equally probable,
the most equal is,
unfortunately, the first one.
Not only have astronomers failed
to detect a planet around Altair, but
even if one does exist, the star's only
been around for about 100 million years.
Compare that to a 4.6 billion-year
veteran like the Sun,
and things start
to look a bit bleak.
Sure, there's always the
possibility that intelligent life
typically evolves much faster
than it did here on Earth,
but we currently have no good
reason to think that's the case.
But it gets worse because even
if the Altairians did respond,
the odds of us even
noticing are extremely remote
because telescopes are expensive,
in low supply, and high demand.
Sacrificing years, months, or even
just days worth of observation time
to screen a single planetless star for
alien signals ain't exactly top priority.
It wasn't until
the summer of 2023
that a team led by
astronomer Shin-ya Narusawa
secured a brief time slot at the
Usuda Deep Space Center in Japan
to search for a belated
response to the Altair Message.
Scheduled once again to coincide
with the annual Tanabata festival,
the search began late in
the evening on August 22
and lasted for a
grand total of 60...
...minutes.
Remaining optimistic, Narusawa told
reporters the following morning
that they wouldn't immediately know
if an alien signal had been detected
because it would take a long time
to analyze the terabytes of collected data.
But given the lack of updates since then,
I wouldn't keep my hopes up on this one.
If nothing else, the Message to Altair
was received loud and clear
by thousands of
children across Japan.
In fact, Call to the Cosmos seems
to have had a bit of a rippling effect
because a whole series of messages
designed by Japanese children
would later be transmitted
for several years in a row.
But before we get to all that,
we're gonna take a brief detour
into the dazzling world of censorship.
As mentioned before,
when the public became aware
that NASA had bolted a plaque to the side
of Pioneer 10, not everyone approved.
But it wasn't just about the risk
of attracting dangerous aliens.
It was also about modesty.
You see, some people
were absolutely mortified
to learn that the plaques featured
line drawings of two naked humans
engaged in the scandalous
act of standing there.
As amusing as that is, the controversy
surrounding the plaques' nudity
has been somewhat
exaggerated over the years.
These puritanical takes were
"muted and few", to quote Carl Sagan,
and it's genuinely difficult to find
examples like the one you just heard.
There were a handful
of reductive headlines,
and some newspapers opted for the
Barbie- and Ken-doll treatment, but
the vast majority published
the full uncensored image and
barely even
mentioned the couple.
In fact, some criticized the plaques
not for showing the human form,
but for not showing enough.
More specifically, people took
issue with the complete
absence of visible
female genitalia,
considering that no such neutering
had been applied to the man.
It's unclear if the lack of anatomical
detail on the lower half of the woman
was demanded by prudish NASA officials, or
a decision made by the Sagans themselves.
Conflicting accounts makes it difficult
to know exactly who's to blame.
Nevertheless, when it came
time to select material
for the Golden Records
a few years later,
these concerns
flared up again.
Fearing a repeat of
the previous debacle,
NASA religiously vetted every
song, soundbite, and image
that Sagan and co
sought to include.
They ultimately rejected
a nude photograph
of a young man
and pregnant woman
intended to show both human
anatomy and procreation.
The reason I'm bringing
this up is because, in 1986,
an American artist
by the name of Joe Davis
decided to fight back against
all this pearl-clutching
with a project known
as Poetica Vaginal.
With the help of a few ballerinas
and other volunteers,
Davis used a custom-made
device to record...
...how do I put this...
...contractions from within
the female reproductive system.
Those pressure oscillations were
then artistically manipulated
to create something that's
meant to resemble human speech.
After obtaining access
to a radio telescope
near the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology,
Davis and his team began
transmitting the sounds into space.
However, the broadcast only
lasted for about 15 to 20 minutes
before the project was prematurely
terminated by an Air Force Colonel,
who was apparently
overseeing the facility.
Nevertheless,
according to Davis,
those few minutes were enough
to transmit brief snippets of audio
to each of the four
selected targets.
Two of them were never publicly
identified, as far as I can tell,
while the other two are known
as Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti.
Epsilon Eridani is home
to one confirmed planet
with a mass nearly
identical to that of Jupiter.
While additional
planets could exist,
including ones that
resemble Earth,
Eridani is a relative newcomer
to the Milky Way family
at approximately half
a billion years young.
On the other hand,
Tau Ceti is certifiably ancient.
Its precise age remains unclear,
but it's definitely older than the Sun
and home to not just one,
but four confirmed planets.
On top of that, there's a slim
chance that two of them
are grazing the inner and outer
bounds of the habitable zone.
That being the
distance from the star
at which water could remain liquid
on the surface of an earthlike planet.
Unfortunately, both of these stars are
surrounded by immense belts of debris,
not unlike the Asteroid and Kuiper
belts in the Solar System.
The difference is that Epsilon
Eridani and Tau Ceti
retain asteroidal and
cometary populations
many times greater than what
currently orbits the Sun.
While this makes perfect sense
for a youngster like Eridani,
it's a lot more concerning for a
galactic grandparent like Tau Ceti.
It implies that something is either
preventing that material from
coalescing into planets
across billions of years
or that the system has suffered
a recent cascade of instability.
In either case, more stuff almost
certainly means more impact events
like the one that nearly
wiped out the dinosaurs.
But even if we optimistically assume
that none of that's a problem,
the mass and size of the planets orbiting
Tau Ceti are highly uncertain.
There's a good chance they
have less in common with Earth
and more so with
Uranus and Neptune.
But even if that
isn't the case,
the chemical makeup of Tau Ceti
appears to be quite different from the Sun,
suggesting its planets
are composed of materials
quite different from those that
spawned life in the Solar System.
In summary,
it's not looking great.
Now, it may seem pointless to consider
the habitability of these distant worlds
when the message we sent towards
them is completely indecipherable.
I mean, if you thought the aliens were
gonna struggle with the Golden Records,
good luck to them
figuring this out.
But just like the Arecibo Message,
the artificial nature of the signal
is a message in
and of itself.
If you want to believe there's a
naturally occurring phenomenon
capable of producing the
exact same radio waves
as those emitted by Joe Davis
and his team back in 1986,
you go right ahead.
But somehow, I have
my doubts about that.
Presuming the message was received and
correctly identified as a technosignature,
we could've received a reply from
the Eridanians as early as 2007
or the Cetinites
as early as 2010.
I did some checking and
regretfully have to inform you
that humanity's been
ghosted once again.
About a decade after
the Message to Altair,
the National Space
Development Agency of Japan
began hosting an annual space
camp event for young children
known as the Cosmic College.
Students could choose from
a bunch of different activities
over the course
of multiple days,
including a class on how to write
and send interstellar messages.
In fact, one of the astronomers
invited to lecture at these events
was none other than Hisashi Hirabayashi,
one of the creators of the Altair Message.
But it wasn't just a
theoretical exercise.
NASDA actually arranged for some of those
messages to be transmitted into space.
Once a year between
at least 1995 and 1998,
simple bitmap images
measuring 11x11 pixels
were sent from the Usuda Deep Space Center
to various locations across the galaxy.
These transmissions received
next to no publicity at the time
and are virtually
unknown to this day.
This makes it difficult to know exactly
what was sent where and when.
Here's what we do know.
The first Cosmic College was
held in August 1995,
during which this image of
two parents and a child
was beamed towards some unknown
destination within the constellation Libra.
Even less is known about this image of
an alien holding hands with a human,
transmitted sometime
in August 1996.
This time, we don't even know
the general region of the sky
to which it might
have been sent.
In August 1997, two bitmaps were beamed
towards a binary star system known as Spica.
The first image
depicts a smiley face,
while the other shows a Japanese
dumpling known as a dango
next to a steaming
cup of tea.
Unfortunately, Spica
is a ticking time bomb
because the two stars are expected
to slowly encroach upon one another,
which could trigger a supernova
at some point in the future.
Even if that wasn't the case, they're far
too young to host an earthlike planet,
and even if that wasn't the case, it
would take another five centuries for
any replies to reach us.
Finally, this image that
simply says 1 + 1 = 2
was transmitted to some
unknown location in August 1998.
Now, there could be more of these
transmissions that have been lost to time.
For instance, an image of a leaf to
symbolize the nature of Earth
appears to have been designed
during the Cosmic College of 1999.
But I couldn't find any information on
whether it was actually beamed into space.
While competitions, art projects,
and recreational programs
certainly could generate
an alien response,
their primary function is to elicit a
response from us down here on Earth.
They're inspiring, provocative,
and generally attract a lot of attention.
So it was only a matter of time
before someone came along
and began charging a fee.
In early 1998, American
entrepreneur Charles Chafer
announced a commercial
venture known as Encounter 2001.
The project sought to crowdfund the
launch of a tiny light-sailing spacecraft
that wouldcarry samples of human
DNA beyond the Solar System.
For only $50, anyone could
submit a few strands of hair
along with a brief
message and their portrait
and join the so-called
Millennial Voyage.
Market analysis by
Chafer and his team
projected sales of anywhere
between 1.5 and 4.5 million tickets
before the launch date.
If those figures
seem a bit optimistic,
they were nothing compared to the
expectations of their customers.
This idea that aliens might one day
use your DNA to clone your body
was surprisingly prevalent.
For instance, the
greeting submitted
by renowned science fiction
author Sir Arthur C. Clarke
simply read,
"Fare well, my clone!"
While the Millennial Voyage was
the project's main objective,
they also promised to beam participants'
greetings into space ahead of the launch
using a radio telescope.
A side project that would come
to be known as the Cosmic Calls.
By spring of 1999, some 43 000 people
had signed up for Encounter 2001,
including two Canadian astrophysicists
named Yvan Dutil and Stéphane Dumas.
Dutil and Dumas had been given the task
of creating what's known as a primer.
A primer attempts to gradually introduce
the recipients to more complex ideas
using some sort of
step-by-step process.
For instance, the primer
of the Message to Altair
were the 13 bitmaps sent alongside the
far more complicated greeting in Japanese.
Dutil and Dumas did something
similar for the Cosmic Calls.
They created a primer
composed of 23 bitmaps,
and this first one starts off by listing
the ten digits of our decimal system
using three different notations:
unary, binary, and decimal.
An idea they appear to have lifted
from this image on the Golden Records,
which did almost
the exact same thing.
But there is, of course, one
very noticeable difference.
The one from the Golden Records uses
the familiar glyphs of Arabic numerals,
whereas the primer to the Cosmic Calls
uses these alien-looking symbols.
That's because Dutil and Dumas
decided to create their own
rudimentary language of sorts.
Now, this might seem
like an odd choice
because whether, say, a two,
looks like this or like this,
it's not gonna make any
difference to the recipients.
But it's not about readability.
It's about redundancy.
You see, there's a lot of naturally
occurring radiation that could
interfere with a radio transmission
between the source and destination.
Imagine, for instance, that we
transmitted fifteen bits arranged like this
to represent the number 8.
If this one bit in the middle
was flipped along the way,
the recipients would
pick up a 0 instead of an 8.
Flip this bit, and
the 8 becomes a 6.
Flip these two,
and it becomes a 5.
In other words, this transmission
has no redundancy whatsoever.
Lose one bit and the entire
message could become corrupted.
The glyphs created by Dutil and Dumas
were designed to be as
fault-tolerant and
noise-resistant as possible.
There are several bits of difference
between all the symbols,
and that still holds true even if
they were to be mirrored or rotated.
But apart from the
symbolic difference,
the Cosmic Call primer follows a structure
that should be very familiar at this point.
The first five pages cover
various mathematical concepts that
gradually increase
in complexity.
The next six delve into
chemistry and physics,
including a schematic
of the Solar System.
The next eight are all about
Earth, humanity, and biology,
including a rendition of the Pioneer couple
and a two-page map of the continents.
Page 21 contains information about
the transmission and telescope,
while page 22 brags about our cosmological
knowledge, like the age of the universe.
The 23rd and final page
invites the aliens to respond
by asking them
a series of questions,
using this flower-looking glyph
as a stand-in for a question mark.
For instance, this means velocity
while this means photon,
so this question could be read as,
"What is the speed of light?"
But how could the
aliens possibly know
that these symbols mean
question, velocity, and photon?
Well, it all comes down
to that first page of numbers
to which everything
else is anchored.
The aliens would start by
hypothesizing that these ten symbols
represent ten digits in a
base-ten numeral system.
With that assumption
locked in place,
they'd move on to the next
page and find 1 something 1 = 2.
Okay, so they now suspect that this
symbol represents addition
and make similar assumptions regarding
subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Once they get to page four, they would
know that this reads something + 2 = 3,
while this reads
something + 4 = 10.
Given that the
same symbol
is used to represent what
is clearly not the same value,
they might suspect that this is a
placeholder for a variable quantity.
In other words, this variable
represents something unknown,
a bit like a question mark,
emphasized by this symbol off to the left.
By gradually introducing new
symbols alongside familiar ones
in such a way that logic and
process of elimination
can be used to
fill in the blanks,
it creates a lot of mutual
corroboration between the pages.
By page eight, they'd be introduced to the
concepts of time and length via hydrogen,
followed by velocity and
photons via the speed of light.
To be clear, there's still plenty of room
for confusion and misinterpretation.
Not least of all because a few typos
did actually slip through the cracks.
For instance, according to
this line on the seventh page,
uranium is said to have 116
neutrons but there is no such element.
The lightest known isotope
of uranium has 122 neutrons
and the most abundant
here on Earth has 146
which is probably
what they meant.
But even if the primer
had been flawless,
there's only so much
hand-holding one can do
when you don't even know if the
recipients have hands.
In addition to the primer, the
language created by Dutil and Dumas
was used to write a message
about the Millennial Voyage.
This was followed by a
copy of the Arecibo Message,
greetings by the staff
at Encounter 2001,
as well as the 43 000 names and
greetings from people around the world.
With assistance from prominent
Russian astronomer Alexander Zaitsev,
Chafer and his team
then obtained access to the
Evpatoria Deep Space
Center in southern Ukraine,
and the first Cosmic Call began
broadcasting on May 24, 1999.
Unlike many other initiatives,
which received very little
attention from the press and public,
the Cosmic Calls were
a global phenomenon.
In fact, the project received
so much attention
that officials at the
National Space Agency of Ukraine
got a bit spooked.
The plan was to beam the
message to four nearby star systems,
but after the first
transmission on May 24,
Ukrainian officials suddenly
shut the whole thing down.
According to Zaitsev,
rumors had begun circulating
that the reason Encounter 2001 were
using the Evpatoria Deep Space Center
was because they'd been denied
access to American facilities
out of concern it might be dangerous
to transmit messages into space.
In reality, other radio
observatories like Arecibo
were simply not available
on the dates requested.
It had nothing to do
with malevolent aliens.
Zaitsev spent over a month
explaining this to the agency
before Chafer and his team were
allowed to resume broadcasting
on the last day of June.
The first target
was 16 Cygni A,
a sunlike star that's
part of a ternary system.
In other words, it's a system
of three stars with Cygni A
being encircled by a
small red dwarf labeled C,
and together, they orbit
another sunlike star labeled B
that's nearly six times further
away than Voyager 1 is from the Sun.
While Cygni B does
have one confirmed planet,
it's an enormous gas giant that
patrols the entire habitable zone,
making it impossible for an
earthlike planet within that region
to maintain a stable orbit.
While the transmission was
specifically directed at Cygni A,
the situation doesn't improve
much because, as far as we know,
it doesn't have any planets.
Instead, it's
orbited by Cygni C
at about twice the distance
between the Sun and Pluto.
It's definitely possible for an earthlike
planet to be sandwiched between them,
but it all comes down to the precise orbit
of Cygni C, which is currently unknown.
The second target was Gliese 746, a binary
system composed of a sunlike primary
and a smaller companion,
of which very little is known.
The distance between them is less
than that between the Sun and Mercury,
so there's no chance of
finding an earthlike planet
in a stable orbit
around either one.
However, there is such a
thing as circumbinary planets
that orbit two
stars at once.
With a system as tightly
bound as Gliese 746,
there's plenty of space for such a
planet to exist, but so far, nothing.
The third target
was 15 Sagittae.
It could be described as a
binary system because Sagittae A
is orbited by this tiny
companion labeled B.
But Sagittae B is what's
known as a brown dwarf
that falls somewhere
between a planet and a star.
It's dozens of times more massive than all
the planets in the Solar System combined,
but still not quite massive
enough to shine like a star.
Apart from Sagittae B, no other
bodies have been detected,
and the system is a bit
on the younger side
at approximately two and
a half billion years old.
Finally, the fourth
target was Gliese 777 A,
a sunlike star that is once again
encircled by a red dwarf companion.
Except, this time, the two are
separated by such an enormous distance
that it takes them upwards of
100 000 years to complete an orbit.
Nevertheless, the target was 777 A,
and it's home to three confirmed planets.
Two of them are many
times more massive than Earth
and are practically
hugging the star,
while the third is a bit more massive
than Jupiter and is much further away.
In between them lies
the habitable zone,
which does appear to be stable
enough to host an earthlike planet,
but none have been
detected to date.
While all of these stars are within
the general solar neighborhood,
we still have to wait
until the 22nd century
until any response could
relativistically be received.
A fact that might come
as a disappointment to some of you,
but no doubt
a relief to others.
But it wasn't just
the general public.
A growing number of experts had
begun to question the ethics and wisdom
of deliberate
communication attempts.
Among them was Carl Sagan,
who, as early as 1983,
began arguing in favor of
"listening rather than sending."
Not so much because
he feared invasion,
but because he felt that
contacting aliens was premature.
He wrote that
"it is not yet clear that we have
anything particularly interesting to say"
due to what he described
as our "backward status."
In other words, a baby
civilization like humanity
probably won't have much
to offer one that's been around
for millions or
billions of years,
so we should prioritize
intelligence gathering
before we start
shouting at the sky.
But astronomers like Alexander Zaitsev
strongly disagreed with that position,
essentially arguing that we must
not give into fear of the unknown.
Sure enough, just a few months
after the first Cosmic Call,
Zaitsev and others began work
on yet another message.
In early 2000, a youth
community center in Moscow
was preparing to host a festival
to celebrate the new millennium.
During the preparations, an astronomy
teacher named Boris Pschenichner
suggested to some of his students that
they should create an interstellar message
to be presented during a
space-themed portion of the event.
The project was spearheaded
by two teenagers
named Egor Kiselev
and Vladimir Filippov
who quickly devised a message
composed of both music and pictures.
Once the project had been approved by a
committee that included Alexander Zaitsev,
it was decided to transmit the
message sometime the following year
to commemorate the 40th anniversary
of the first crewed spaceflight
by cosmonaut
Yuri Gagarin in 1961.
Zaitsev expanded upon the
ideas of Kiselev and Filippov
by suggesting the message be
divided into three distinct signal types:
constant,
continuous,
and discrete.
The constant signal
would be sent first
to let the aliens know that they've
picked up something strange.
That probing beacon would then
transition into a continuous signal
conveying the musical
component of the message.
Finally, two discrete frequencies would
be used to broadcast binary-coded images.
According to Zaitsev,
the three formats
represented the language of
nature, emotion, and logic.
A total of nine musical
compositions were selected,
and Zaitsev proposed using an electronic
instrument known as a theremin.
Partly because it generates a smooth
monophonic signal with minimal overtones,
but also because the theremin
was a Russian invention.
The visual portion of the message
was composed of 28 bitmaps
primarily designed by
Kiselev and Filippov.
The first image depicts
a wave within a circle,
which is meant to convey to the
aliens that the circle's diameter
is equal to the wavelength
of the transmission.
If they correctly
make that guess,
the next image is meant to
be scaled so that this circle
with a human
face in the center
matches the diameter of the circle
from the previous image.
Doing so would enable them
to decode other components,
like how this wavelength corresponds
to a spectral absorption line of water.
Without going into
too much detail here,
it's meant to highlight the significance
of water to life here on Earth.
While some of the illustrations tried to
convey information using science and logic,
a lot of it was
artistically motivated.
Life inhabits the ocean,
land, and atmosphere,
represented by dolphins,
humans, and birds
that the aliens will, of course,
have no chance of deciphering.
The ten circles along the edge,
numbered 1 through 10,
not only symbolize our use
of a base-ten numeral system,
but also correspond
to the next ten images.
The first of which is this
side-view of our galaxy
with an arrow
pointing at us.
The second is a schematic
of the Solar System.
The third gets a bit closer.
The fourth gets closer still.
Then there's a family,
a house,
and a close-up of a person.
Towards the end, there's also
a yin and yang symbol,
two games of tic-tac-toe,
and an illustration of the telescope
used to transmit the message.
But it doesn't end there because the next
image is the same emblem we saw before,
except the ten
outlying circles
have now been filled in with
the ten preceding images.
Exactly why they're laid out in this
circular pattern in this particular order,
or even what
function it all serves,
I couldn't tell you.
But, again, the emblem was intended
to be both informational and artistic.
Following the emblem sequence,
the next three images
contain some text written
in both Russian and English.
Approximately 1 000 students between the
ages of 13 and 18 participated in the project,
and this is an extreme abbreviation
of their many proposed greetings.
It very innocently ends with...
Signed by...
The final twelve bitmaps depict
illustrations that we've already seen,
each one captioned with a brief
description in both Russian and English.
They're meant to function
as a sort of dictionary
with the hopelessly
optimistic goal
of teaching the aliens how to
read the aforementioned greeting.
The three components of the message,
starting with the probing signal,
followed by the music,
and the 28 bitmaps,
were then transmitted from the Evpatoria
Deep Space Center on August 29, 2001.
Much like the first Cosmic Call,
the Teenage Message was transmitted
multiple times over multiple days.
This time to six different targets.
The first one was Gliese 797 A, an as
of yet planetless but sunlike star
that forms a wide ternary system
with two smaller companions.
The second target was 37 Geminorum,
a solitary sunlike star that
has yet to show any signs
of hosting a
planetary system.
Target number three was another
sunlike star known as 47 Ursae Majoris,
which is home to
three confirmed planets.
They all appear to be gas giants,
and the one closest to the star
is grazing the outer edge
of the habitable zone.
Because it's more than
twice the mass of Jupiter,
its immense gravity renders nearly
the whole outer half of the habitable zone
completely off limits.
An earthlike planet
within this region
simply wouldn't be able
to maintain a stable orbit.
But if such a planet were
to be located further inwards,
things look a lot
more optimistic.
The fourth target
was Gliese 547 A.
Once again, it's a sunlike star
that forms a wide binary system
with a small brown
dwarf companion.
Apart from that,
no planets as of yet.
Target number five was yet another
sunlike star known as Gliese 327
with no confirmed planets.
It does, however, show signs of
being surrounded by either one
or multiple
belts of debris.
But the precise mass, composition, and
extent of this debris remains to be seen.
Finally, the sixth
target was Gliese 788.
It is yet another solar analog with
neither stellar nor planetary companions.
All but one of the targets are
more than 50 lightyears away, so
the minimum response
time is over a century.
The one exception is
47 Ursae Majoris at 45 lightyears,
so we could hear back from
the Majorans as early as 2092.
As the name Encounter
2001 would seem to imply,
the Millennial Voyage was
scheduled to launch by the end of 2001.
But shortly before
the start of that year,
the project was quietly
rebranded as Team Encounter.
While it's difficult to know exactly
what was going on behind the scenes,
it seems like they vastly
overestimated the public's interest
in sending
messages into space.
As mentioned before, the
team expected to attract
somewhere between
1.5 and 4.5 million customers.
A few months after launch,
they had sold 45...
...tickets.
While sales ramped up quite a
bit before the first Cosmic Call,
43 000 customers was still a far cry
from the millions they had anticipated.
With such lackluster
performance,
the company had no choice but to
push back the launch date
of the Millennial Voyage by several years
and changed the name to Team Encounter.
But even after significant delays,
a few celebrity endorsements,
and numerous attempts
to get people interested,
sales lagged behind
expectations by a wide margin.
By the summer of 2003, the company's
main investor finally pulled the plug,
 and the project was
summarily abandoned.
While this meant the
Millennial Voyage was dead,
Team Encounter did at the
very least uphold their promise
of transmitting a
second Cosmic Call.
The composition of which
was very similar to the first.
Just like before, it
started with a primer
designed by Yvan Dutil
and Stéphane Dumas.
However, they actually
created a new set of glyphs,
even more
noise-resistant than the first.
The 23 bitmaps were also redesigned
and combined into one large image,
but the contents of the primer
stayed more or less the same.
This was followed by a
copy of the Arecibo Message,
a few images from
the Teenage Message,
a description of the now
canceled Millennial Voyage,
and greetings by the
staff at Team Encounter.
Last but not least was
the commercial payload.
This included not just the names and
greetings of more than 100 000 customers,
but also more unique contributions
like a chatbot program called Ella,
the contents of
an entire website,
and the song Starman
by David Bowie.
All of which was, of course,
converted into binary
before being
transmitted into space
from the Evpatoria Deep Space
Center on July 6, 2003.
[Hugh Downs]
The people of the planet Earth
send their greetings and friendship to you,
across lightyears of interstellar space.
The message we send to you today contains
information about our Solar System,
our planet,
and ourselves.
We invite you to contact us and to share
your knowledge, culture, and wisdom.
May this Cosmic Call open an exciting
dialogue between our two stars
here in the Milky Way galaxy.
Much like the first Cosmic Call, the
second was beamed toward multiple targets.
There were five in total, and
the first one was Gliese 67.
It's a binary system
composed of a sunlike primary
and a red dwarf companion that takes
about 20 years to complete an orbit.
While neither one is
known to harbor any planets,
and the distance between
them is less than that
between the Sun and
Jupiter at closest approach,
they're still far enough
apart for an earthlike planet
within their respective habitable
zones to maintain a stable orbit.
The second target
was Gliese 208 A,
which is only about half
the size and mass of the Sun
and forms a wide binary system
with an even smaller companion.
No planets as of yet, and it could
be as young as half a billion years,
which would make it unlikely
to host a spacefaring civilization.
Target number three
was 55 Cancri A,
a star that's a bit fainter
and colder than the Sun,
with a distant red
dwarf companion.
It's the host of five
confirmed planets,
with the fourth one, dubbed Harriot,
orbiting within the habitable zone.
Now, because Harriot's mass is at
least three times that of Neptune,
it's not a very likely
candidate for life as we know it.
But it's not inconceivable for life to
have emerged on an earthlike moon
in orbit around Harriot.
Not only that, but it is possible for an
earthlike planet to maintain a stable orbit
within the outer half
of the habitable zone,
although simulations suggest that such
a planet is far more likely to have formed
just outside of it.
The fourth target
was 47 Ursae Majoris,
which was previously the
target of the Teenage Message,
making this the first time we've
signaled the same star more than once.
Finally, the fifth
target was Gliese 49,
which has a lot in common
with the second target.
It's a red dwarf about half
the size and mass of the Sun
that probably forms an
extremely wide binary system
with an even
smaller companion.
While a planet with a mass of
more than five times that of Earth
has been detected
around the primary,
it's unlikely to be habitable
due to its proximity to the star.
But even if that wasn't the case,
the system is probably too young
to host a communicative
civilization in the first place.
Nevertheless, Gliese 49 is the
least distant of the five targets
at 32 lightyears,
meaning any potential replies
could reach us no sooner than 2067.
Now, two years after
the second Cosmic Call
in the small European
Republic of San Marino,
Hungarian astronomer Iván Almár
proposed a ten-point scale
for quantifying the risk
of interstellar messages.
According to this scale, a
transmission like the Arecibo Message
carries a risk of 8, which is characterized
as a far-reaching threat to humanity.
Meanwhile, the two
Cosmic Calls and the Teenage Message
supposedly carry a risk of 7,
giving them a threat level of high.
While the risk factor is partially
determined by objective metrics
like signal strength
and duration,
it's also based on the
contents of a message.
This makes the San Marino Scale
inherently subjective,
and it also fails to consider other
crucial factors like the distance to
and habitability of the target.
That being said, the creation
of the San Marino Scale
is a fascinating
development because
it highlights just how contentious
the transmission debate had become.
Many prominent figures
within the SETI community,
that being the
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,
had become a lot more
hesitant or outright opposed
to what had come
to be known as METI,
Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
A term coined by none
other than Alexander Zaitsev
during the creation of
the Teenage Message.
Pushing back against this
growing opposition to METI,
Zaitsev reasoned that
"in a galaxy where everyone is
listening and no one is speaking...
...someone has to
make the first move."
He called attention to a poll showing that
78% of more than 140 000 SETI enthusiasts
were, in fact,
in support of METI.
What he doesn't mention is that
over half of those same respondents
were still unsure if the aliens
they were hoping to contact
were more likely to
be friendly or hostile.
Throughout the 1990s,
there was increasing demand within
NASA to launch a mission to Pluto.
At the time, it was the last
unexplored planet of the Solar System,
and even our most powerful telescopes
could resolve nothing but a nebulous disc.
After numerous failed attempts
to secure the necessary funding,
the spacecraft New Horizons was
successfully launched on January 19, 2006.
[Announcer]
Five.
[Announcer]
Four.
[Announcer]
Three.
[Announcer]

[Announcer]
One.
We have ignition and liftoff of
NASA's New Horizons spacecraft
on a decade long voyage to visit
the planet Pluto and then beyond.
After borrowing some extra
speed from the almighty Jupiter,
New Horizons finally
caught up with Pluto in 2015.
At the time of the launch, Pluto
was still recognized as a planet.
But only seven
months into the mission,
it was reclassified by the
International Astronomical Union
as a dwarf planet.
A decision that remains
somewhat controversial to this day.
Although, strictly
semantically speaking,
a dwarf planet
is still a planet.
It's right there
in the name.
Anyway, much like the
Pioneer and Voyager probes,
New Horizons continued on into deep
space, destined to leave the Solar System
and roam the galaxy.
Yet unlike its predecessors,
it does not carry a message.
According to lead
scientist Alan Stern,
the inclusion of a plaque was
brought up during the planning stages.
But he ultimately
rejected that proposal
out of concern it might
spark some sort of controversy
that could take focus
away from the mission.
Not unlike what happened
back in the '70s, when
actual adult human beings
realized that underneath our clothes
is not more clothes.
Given that New Horizons
was but the latest
in a long series of failed attempts
to launch a mission to Pluto,
Stern did not want to risk
yet another delay or worse.
But as stern as Stern might have
been regarding a deliberate message,
he was not opposed to the inclusion of
nine symbolic items described as mementos,
placed within the nooks and
crannies of the spacecraft.
The most significant of which
was this aluminum canister
containing the ashes
of Clyde Tombaugh,
the American astronomer
who discovered Pluto in 1930.
Shortly before his
passing in 1997,
Tombaugh requested that his
cremains be launched into space,
and what better way
to honor that request
than to sail him past the
planet that he discovered.
The other eight mementos included
two flags of the United States;
two state quarters, one from
Maryland and one from Florida,
honoring the states in which
the probe was built and launched;
a chunk of SpaceShipOne,
paying tribute to the first successful
crewed spaceflight by a private company;
a postage stamp describing Pluto as
the only planet "NOT YET EXPLORED";
an off-the-shelf
CD on the port side,
loaded with the names of
more than 400 000 people
who signed up during
an online campaign;
and another CD on
the starboard side,
loaded with notes
and photographs
of people responsible for designing,
building, and launching New Horizons.
According to Stern,
these artifacts were
"more efforts of the
heart than the head"
and were intended
for us here on Earth,
not whomever might stumble
upon the probe in the distant future.
In fact, commercial
CDs degrade over time
and become unreadable within
decades or a few centuries at most.
Although, those estimates
assume an earthlike environment,
not a spacecraft floating
through the vacuum of space
while being shielded from a lot of
otherwise damaging ultraviolet radiation
by a thermal blanket.
Somehow, longevity estimates for a
CD being stored in those conditions
never came up in
the search results.
Anyway, the lack of a
deliberate physical message
bothered some people
enough that in 2013,
one of the makers of the
Golden Records, Jon Lomberg,
launched a campaign
to create a digital one.
The idea was for people
around the world to submit
sounds, images,
and other material
that could be uploaded to one of the
memory banks aboard the spacecraft.
While there was a lot of
public support for the project
and Alan Stern was
open to the idea,
the One Earth message
never materialized.
After a failed Kickstarter
campaign in 2017,
Lomberg stated in 2020 that
NASA had initially said, "Yes",
but later
changed their minds.
Even if the project
had succeeded,
the One Earth message would've been
no less symbolic than the nine mementos
because, just like a compact disc,
computer memory degrades over time.
Even in the most
optimistic of circumstances,
we're talking centuries,
possibly a few millennia at best.
While it is a bit disappointing
that no deliberate
lasting message was
included with New Horizons,
let's not forget that the
probe itself is a message.
One that would provide any
recipients with immediate confirmation
that they're not alone.
Although, that's presuming, of
course, the probe is ever found.
As I'm recording this,
New Horizons has not been directed
towards any particular star system,
but that could
change in the future.
Following its encounter
with Pluto in 2015
and this malformed
space-potato in 2019,
the probe is now gliding
through empty space
while astronomers keep
searching for additional flyby targets.
So far, none have
been detected,
but the probe has enough juice to
keep going until at least the 2040s.
So a few decades from now,
shortly before it runs out of power,
NASA could choose to steer
the probe towards a star system
in its general
direction of travel.
While such a course-corrected
voyage would still take untold eons, and
humanity could be long
gone by the time it arrives,
I think it would be quite exciting to know
that one of our foremost ambassadors
was headed for something
rather than nothing.
In early 2008, a man
named Martin Lewis
approached NASA with the idea of beaming
The Beatles song Across the Universe
across the universe.
As a Beatles historian,
Lewis sought to commemorate the
40th anniversary of the song's recording,
and NASA seems to have agreed
because the year also happened to mark
the 50th anniversary
of the agency's founding.
Using a massive antenna at the
Deep Space Communications Complex
located west of Madrid
in the middle of Spain,
the nearly 4-minute song was beamed
towards Polaris, the famous North Star,
 on February 4, 2008.
Former Beatles member Paul McCartney
approved of the message by saying...
But it's highly unlikely
for Polaris to be inhabited.
For one thing, it's not a solitary
star but a system of three.
The primary is a supergiant that's about
two and a half thousand times brighter
and nearly fifty times
larger than the Sun.
Placed at the center
of the Solar System,
its radius would extend
about halfway to Mercury.
Meanwhile, its closest companion
is a bit more massive than the Sun
and takes nearly 30 years
to complete an orbit.
This tight-knit binary system
is then encircled by a third star
that's many tens
of Pluto orbits away.
No planets have been
discovered as of yet, but
even if an earthlike
planet with a stable orbit
could be found within one
of the stars' habitable zones,
Polaris probably hasn't
existed long enough
for intelligent life
to have emerged.
While the two companions
could be as old as two billion years,
it seems like the primary has only
been around for a few tens of millions.
As if that was
not bad enough,
Across the Universe won't arrive
until the middle of the 25th century
because Polaris is more
than 400 lightyears away.
In the spring of 2008,
the brand Doritos launched a
campaign in the United Kingdom called
You Make It, We Play It.
The idea was for members of the public
to create a short commercial about Doritos,
and the winning entry would not
only be played on national television,
but also
beamed into space.
From a radar station in the middle
of Svalbard in the Arctic Circle,
a six-hour loop of the 30-second
advert departed Earth on June 12, 2008.
The target was, once
again, 47 Ursae Majoris,
meaning we've now dispatched three
separate messages to this singular star.
Presuming the
Majorans are listening,
they'll be hearing the
Teenage Message in late 2046,
the second
Cosmic Call in late 2048,
and an unprompted admission
that we like to hasten our mortal doom
by voluntarily consuming
dusty triangles of death
sometime in late 2053.
Response time?
Let's hope not.
In the summer of 2008,
a now-defunct social
media platform named Bebo
launched a project known
as A Message From Earth.
It primarily functioned as a publicity
stunt to advertise the website,
and like so many initiatives before it,
crowdsourced the creation of a message
by inviting its users to
submit text and images.
Some untold number of submissions,
and several months later,
the 501 most upvoted entries
were beamed into space
from the Evpatoria Deep
Space Center on October 9, 2008.
Considering that this
was open to the internet,
I strongly suspect many messages were a
lot less sanitized than what we just heard.
But since participation required you to
be logged in and Bebo went offline in 2013,
very little of A Message From Earth
has been preserved.
Nevertheless, the target was a
red dwarf known as Gliese 581
that's a lot smaller, lighter,
fainter, and colder than the Sun.
What this means is that an
earthlike planet within this system
has to orbit very
close to its star
to receive the same amount
of energy as the Earth.
So close, in fact, that the outer edge
of the habitable zone around Gliese 581
is closer than Mercury is
to the Sun by a wide margin.
With planets orbiting so close, it
makes them vulnerable to flaring events,
and it just so happens that red dwarfs have
a penchant for sudden bursts of radiation.
Not only can these eruptions have a
sterilizing effect on nearby planets,
but if there's one thing that life
on Earth does not appreciate,
it's sudden and dramatic
changes to the climate.
Not that we would know anything
about that, now, would we?
The good news
is that Gliese 581
has a better chance than most
of hosting an earthlike planet
because it's very old, and
therefore a lot less active
than many of its
younger siblings.
It's also quite close at
less than 21 lightyears,
meaning a reply could
arrive as early as 2049.
Even more promising
is that shortly before
and after A Message From Earth
was transmitted,
astronomers discovered
not just one, but two planets
a few times more
massive than Earth
orbiting within the
star's habitable zone.
Unfortunately, follow-up studies
failed to corroborate those findings,
suggesting the initially planet-looking
signals were nothing more than noise.
Unless additional planets
can be found in the future,
any remaining
hope of life
falls to the three confirmed
planets that lie a bit further inward.
However, due to their even
greater proximity to the star with
orbital periods of
only a few days,
chances are they're less
earthlike and more mercurylike.
To commemorate
the 400th anniversary
of astronomical contributions made by
Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler in 1609,
the United Nations along with the
International Astronomical Union
declared 2009 the
International Year of Astronomy.
Unsure of how best to
celebrate this milestone,
a representative of the
Australian government
reached out to a popular science
magazine known as Cosmos.
The magazine's editor-in-chief,
Wilson da Silva,
suggested they transmit
an interstellar message
during an upcoming annual event
known as National Science Week.
They were soon given the
green light by the government,
and after consulting a bunch of
astronomers, NASA, and others,
Cosmos launched a website
called Hello From Earth.
The project was described by
da Silva as "Twitter to the Stars"
because the idea was to allow
anyone to submit a brief text message
of no more than 160
characters in length.
When the submission period came
to a close less than two weeks later,
the website had received
nearly 26 000 messages.
According to da Silva, less
than 1% of the comments
contained some sort of rule-breaking
content like profanity, slurs, and so on.
They were also
forced by NASA
to remove anything deemed
even remotely sexual or aggressive,
like the word "breast" and the
phrase "all your base are belong to us",
which is just a line from an old
video game that later became a meme.
As someone who's old enough to have been
around back when this meme was still popular,
this might be one of the most depressing
things I've ever had to explain in a video.
Painful reminders that we're all stuck on a
travelator towards eternal nothingness aside,
once all the messages had
been vetted and approved,
they were transmitted
from a large antenna
at the Canberra Deep Space
Communications Complex
in the Australian southeast
on August 28, 2009.
Much like A Message From Earth,
Hello From Earth
was also directed towards
the nearby red dwarf Gliese 581.
As mentioned before,
observations conducted back then
suggested the presence of two
planets within the star's habitable zone,
but those findings
have since been refuted.
Nevertheless, Gliese 581 is now the
second star to be signaled more than once
 after 47 Ursae Majoris.
While the
International Year of Astronomy
was primarily dedicated
to Galileo and Kepler,
2009 also marked the 35th
anniversary of the Arecibo Message.
Something that American artist Joe Davis
decided to celebrate in his own unique way.
One of the most vital biological
mechanisms on Earth is photosynthesis,
the ability of some
organisms like plants and algae
to produce life-essential oxygen using
water, sunlight, and carbon dioxide.
Now, a crucial component of photosynthesis
is a special molecule known as RuBisCO.
RuBisCO is what's known as a protein,
or more specifically an enzyme,
that's been around
for billions of years.
Presuming the evolution of life here on
Earth is typical rather than special,
one possible way to
communicate with an alien species
would be to send them very
basic biological information.
If their path to intelligence bears
any resemblance to our own,
there's a chance they'll
recognize an enzyme
as ancient and
rudimentary as RuBisCO.
This was the idea that occurred
to Joe Davis in late 2009.
But instead of using something
more conventional like binary code,
he decided to map the RuBisCO gene sequence
to four increasingly syllabic phrases
alluding to an
ancient Greek proverb.
These were then vocalized and
turned into a 15-minute audio sample
using the text-to-speech
feature on a regular iPhone.
Now, if you feel like you couldn't
quite follow all of that, no need to worry.
There's zero chance
the aliens will either.
Much like Davis' previous project, the
RuBisCO Stars Message was largely symbolic
and primarily intended to evoke a
reaction from people here on Earth.
Nevertheless, using his
academic connections,
Davis managed to book
time at the Arecibo Telescope.
Then, on November 7, 2009,
just over a week before the 35th
anniversary of the Arecibo Message,
a frequency-shifted audio
recording of a synthetic voice
rattling off fragmentary sentences
representing the RuBisCO gene sequence
was beamed towards
three nearby stars.
The first target was TZ Arietis, a red
dwarf less than 15 lightyears away
with one confirmed planet
approaching the mass of Saturn.
It's a very active
flare star so
even if an earthlike planet could be found,
it's unlikely to host life as we know it.
Meanwhile, the third
target was Kappa¹ Ceti,
a sunlike star barely
30 lightyears from Earth.
While it is similar to the Sun,
it's also a lot younger,
making it unlikely that
sufficient time has elapsed
for a communicative
civilization to have emerged.
But the second target
is a lot more interesting.
It's another red dwarf
known as Teegarden's Star,
and while it does
exhibit occasional flaring,
it's a lot older and much less
active than most of its kind.
Furthermore, it's home
to three confirmed planets
with masses very
similar to that of Earth,
and two of them orbit
within the habitable zone.
To quote a recent paper,
they are "among the most
Earth-like exoplanets currently known."
But earthlike does not
necessarily mean habitable
because flares are but one obstacle
that red dwarf planets have to overcome.
Another potential hazard is
something known as tidal locking.
Without going into
too much detail,
the simplest form of tidal locking is
when the rotation of a celestial body
becomes synchronized
with its orbital period.
The most famous
example of this is the Moon.
It completes precisely one rotation
for every orbit around the Earth,
which is why we only ever
see one side of the Moon.
The reason this happens is a bit
complicated, but it's tied to proximity.
The tighter the orbit,
the more likely it is for a celestial
body to become tidally locked to its host.
As you can imagine, planets orbiting
red dwarfs are especially susceptible,
as they have to orbit
very close to their star
to retain liquid water
on their surface.
Sure enough, the three
planets orbiting Teegarden's Star
are all believed to be tidally
locked, just like the Moon.
This is less than ideal
because it means that one hemisphere
is cooked by everlasting starlight
while the other is
plunged into eternal night.
Habitability estimates
for such bisected worlds
range from extremely
pessimistic to cautiously optimistic
because some
climate models suggest
warm air from the dayside
creeps into the nightside,
which pushes cold air from the
nightside into the dayside, and so on.
The end result of which is a planet
with a surprisingly temperate climate
that keeps water at perfect equilibrium
between freezing and evaporating.
But even if we accept
the more optimistic models,
the proximity of
red dwarf planets
also makes them less likely to
retain an atmosphere in the first place.
That's because stars tend to shed
vast quantities of material into space,
and the closer you get, the more
intense that stellar wind becomes.
As if that was not bad enough,
this wind is occasionally
interrupted by more explosive events
like coronal mass ejections that can expel
billions of tons of superheated plasma
in a matter of minutes.
Here's one being ejected from the
Sun with the Earth hauntingly to scale.
In the case of
Teegarden's Star
the two innermost planets are
between 9 and 15 times closer
than Mercury is to the Sun.
It only takes them 11 and 5 days,
respectively, to complete an orbit.
According to one recent study, that's
close enough for the stellar winds alone
to completely strip those
planets of a lasting atmosphere.
While atmospheric erosion could be
mitigated by a strong magnetic field
like the one that
surrounds the Earth,
the magnetosphere
of tidally locked planets
would likely be reduced
by their sluggish rotation.
All that being said, the habitability of
red dwarf planets remains open to debate.
There is so much
we don't know, and
theories, simulations,
and mathematical models
can only do so much
to fill in the blanks.
Red dwarfs account for approximately three
quarters of all stars in the Milky Way,
so it would be a real shame if not a single
one of them can support life as we know it.
It's possible that some environments
are conducive to life while others are not.
The tricky part is determining
where that line should be drawn.
Presuming the planets
orbiting Teegarden's Star
have, in fact, cradled beings
of sufficient intelligence,
a reply to the RuBisCO Stars
Message could be heading our way
right this very moment.
The signal would've reached
the Teegardenese back in 2022,
which amounts to a
roundtrip ETA of 2034.
Don't forget to
mark your calendars.
No, genuinely this time.
Late one evening
on August 15, 1977,
the Big Ear Telescope in the US state of
Ohio performed a routine survey of the sky.
A few days later, a
volunteer named Jerry Ehman
sat down to review
the collected data.
What he found was a
signal so exceptionally strong
that he encircled the
sequence on the printout sheet
and famously wrote "Wow!"
in the left-hand margin.
The Wow! Signal remains
a mystery to this day.
Not least of all because it
was never detected again
despite numerous
attempts to do so.
The sequence 6-E-Q-U-J-5
is not some sort of code
but merely the intensity
of the signal over time,
where numbers above 9 are
represented by letters to save space.
It makes a lot more sense if
we plot it onto a graph like this.
It begins with a value of 6,
meaning it was six times more
intense than normal background noise.
The signal then jumped
up to 14, followed by 26,
and a peak intensity of
30 times above background.
The signal then fell back down to
19 and then 5, before it disappeared.
Each of the six samples were
recorded 12 seconds apart
and this 72-second
rise and fall
is perfectly consistent with the
telescope panning over the source
along with the Earth's rotation.
In other words, the
source of the Wow! Signal
appears to have been more or less fixed
in the night sky, much like a distant star.
Had it been an earthbound source it
would have moved with the telescope
while things like
airplanes and satellites
would likely have moved too fast to
remain visible for the whole 72 seconds.
The Wow! Signal was
also tantalizingly close
to the frequency of the
aforementioned hydrogen line.
This makes it even less
likely to be man-made because
it falls within a protected band of
frequencies reserved for radio astronomy.
On top of that, it had a
very narrow bandwidth.
What this means is that,
unlike a star, for instance,
which emits radiation across a
wide spectrum of frequencies,
the Wow! Signal
was very focused.
It's by no means impossible for a natural
source to produce such a concentrated beam,
 but it is unusual.
This is what makes the
Wow! Signal so curious.
It bears all the hallmarks
of a technosignature.
Just as we have
identified hydrogen,
the most abundant element in the
universe, as a means of initiating contact,
the aliens could've
done the same.
Just as we tend to transmit extremely
brief non-repeating messages,
the aliens could
be doing the same.
Unfortunately, the peculiar
design of the Big Ear Telescope
makes it impossible to
pinpoint the source of the signal.
The setup was such that two large
swaths of sky were scanned simultaneously,
but there's no way to tell them
apart when looking at the data.
Even more peculiar is that the
signal was only detected once
despite this
dual-scanning design.
This can only mean
one of two things.
Scenario one is that the source had
been transmitting for some
indeterminate amount of
time ahead of the first scan,
yet ceased transmitting before it
could be detected again by the second.
Scenario two is that the
source began transmitting
during the roughly three minute
window between the two scans,
and continued to do so
for who knows how long.
Now, for a signal to carry information,
it has to exhibit some sort of pattern.
For instance, we tend to encode our
messages by using a binary pattern
that shifts back and forth
between two different frequencies
or levels of amplitude.
The Wow! Signal did not
exhibit any such pattern.
Both its frequency
and amplitude
had a constant unmodulated
appearance throughout the whole thing.
That being said, we
can't rule out the possibility
that a sequence of
fluctuations were present
but that they fell below the threshold of
what the Big Ear telescope could detect.
No instrument has
infinite resolution
and Big Ear had some
quite significant blind spots.
To quote Ehman...
On the off-chance that the Wow! Signal
was a message from another civilization,
the National Geographic Channel decided to
transmit a reply on its 35th anniversary.
After collecting over 17 000 tweets and
about a dozen video-recorded greetings
by various celebrities
and public figures,
the Wow! Reply was beamed into space from
the Arecibo Telescope on August 15, 2012.
At least that is what
the public was told.
But after contacting someone who worked at
Arecibo when this transmission took place,
they told me that the stress of beaming
thousands of messages into space
had caused the aging transmitter
to overheat and break down.
They could not recall how many
messages made it through, but
it could have been as
few as just a single one.
Now, because the details of the project had
already been publicized ahead of time,
and no correction
was ever issued,
everyone assumed the Wow! Reply
went off without a hitch.
But not only is it unclear
how many tweets were sent,
it's also unclear where they went because
the Wow! Reply had three intended targets.
They were all sunlike stars known as
HD 54351, 37 Geminorum, and 55 Cancri A.
Very little is known
about the first,
and it's quite some distance
away at 140 lightyears.
Meanwhile, the other
two are much closer
and have both been targeted
by previous METI experiments.
The person I spoke to could not
recall which one was targeted first, so
my best guess
is HD 54351
because that's the one listed first
in a press release about the project.
Now, with a name
like Wow! Reply,
you'd think the three targets were
located within one of the two regions
from which the Wow! Signal
is known to have originated.
Well, if you did think that, it might be
time to recalibrate your common sense
because all three targets are not
only located outside these regions
but in the complete
opposite direction.
The reason for
this is very simple.
The location where the
Wow! Signal was detected
was beyond the reach of the upward-facing
and stationary Arecibo Telescope.
But if that's the case, why even call
it the Wow! Reply in the first place?
Apart from being transmitted
on its 35th anniversary,
none of this had anything
to do with the Wow! Signal.
While the signal does have the
hallmarks of an alien transmission,
there's still a very good chance it
was caused by a natural phenomenon.
It's just a matter of
identifying the correct one.
For instance, one
recent hypothesis
tried to blame the whole episode
on a pair of passing comets,
but like all previous
explanations,
this one has failed to
withstand further scrutiny.
More recently, a paper published in
2024 hypothesized that a powerful flare
ejected by something
like a magnetar
could've been amplified
by a cloud of hydrogen,
which would explain
the signal's frequency.
Whether this is the solution
that will finally crack the case
or be relegated to the
mounting list of dead ends,
only time will tell.
In the early 2010s, a film
editor named Pierre Fabre
conceived of a project
dubbed Lone Signal.
Much like Team Encounter
and the Cosmic Calls,
Lone Signal was an attempt to
commercialize interstellar messaging.
The project was envisioned
as a social media platform
where anyone could submit
text, images, audio, and video
for direct
transmission into space.
Another similarity between
Lone Signal and the Cosmic Calls
was the inclusion of a primer written
in a mathematical language of sorts.
Constructed by planetary
scientist Michael Busch,
every component of this language is
represented by a string of eight digits
between 0 and 7.
For instance,
1 + 1 = 2 looks like this,
and here on the right is an
example of some basic algebra.
Things only become more
complicated from there,
but I'll spare you the details
because, according to Busch,
the technique used to encode
the primer into the signal
was far too fragile to survive the
years-long trip across interstellar space.
While the signal
could still be detected,
any patterns would become
scrambled along the way,
making it impossible to extract and
decode the primer at the destination.
In other words, alien astronomers may
end up with their own Wow! Signal
that doesn't seem to
fluctuate in any meaningful way
yet whose properties may still be
difficult to ascribe to a natural source.
Now, what truly sets Lone Signal apart from
every other initiative mentioned so far
is that it wasn't
a one-time thing.
Instead of transmitting the primer
and public greetings all in one go,
Lone Signal sought to
establish a permanent beacon
that would continuously transmit
for years or even decades.
To make that happen, they couldn't
just book time at an active observatory
but had to obtain long-term
exclusive control over a telescope.
After shopping around for a bit, they
eventually secured a 30-year lease
on a decommissioned telescope
in southwestern California
called the
Jamesburg Earth Station.
Then, after upgrading some
of its aging equipment,
Lone Signal began
transmitting on June 17, 2013.
But the team behind Lone
Signal had even greater ambitions.
Their long-term plan
was to raise $100 million
and to establish a network of
telescopes to continuously signal
multiple targets
all at once.
They likened themselves to SpaceX
and hoped to create a global platform
from which anyone in the world
could beam any random thought
directly into
space all day long.
But in a classic case of
history repeating itself,
the team behind Lone Signal,
much like Team Encounter before them,
vastly overestimated the
public's interest in METI.
Less than two
months after launch,
revenue from the website barely
covered 2% of their operational costs.
Pierre Fabre later
wrote in a comment...
...and that failure led investors
to ultimately pull the plug.
Nevertheless, the transmission target was
yet another red dwarf called Gliese 526.
It's less than 18 lightyears away
and about twice as old as the Sun.
While it is a relatively quiescent
star with only occasional flaring,
a planetary system
has yet to be detected.
Should it be home to a
spacefaring civilization,
they will have upwards of two
months to notice our cosmic shouting,
beginning in early 2031.
Back in prehistoric times,
not long after you pressed
play on this documentary,
I mentioned a series of
METI experiments carried out
by the National Space Development Agency
of Japan in the mid-to-late 1990s.
Designed by young students
attending a NASDA space camp,
these five bitmap images were transmitted
from the Usuda Deep Space Center
to various locations
across the galaxy.
Fast forward to 2013,
and the successor to NASDA,
the Japan Aerospace
Exploration Agency,
decided it was
time to try again.
During a similar space camp event,
and using the same telescope as before,
JAXA retransmitted this image of two
parents and a child on September 22, 2013.
A similar bitmap depicting a
human standing next to the Sun
was then transmitted the
following year on August 23,
although it's unclear
exactly what it looked like.
Nevertheless, both images
were directed at 55 Cancri A
which has been
targeted in the past
and discussed in more
detail in a previous chapter.
But much like what happened back in
the '90s, the JAXA Space Camp Messages
flew as much through the
radar as they did under it.
Instead, these events were largely
overshadowed by new developments
in the ongoing
transmission debate.
Most notably, in early 2015, over two
dozen scientists and SETI enthusiasts,
including a
pre-disgraced Elon Musk,
signed a petition calling for a
"worldwide consensus" regarding METI.
They took issue with the fact that
past METI experiments had been
"based upon the wishes
of a few individuals"
rather than a "broadly
representative body".
In part because the aliens are likely to be
"millions of years more advanced than us",
but also because "it is impossible to predict
whether [they] will be benign or hostile."
The petition concluded that the
potential "consequences of contact"
demanded "worldwide scientific,
political and humanitarian discussion"
in advance of any
future transmissions.
To which an artist in collaboration with
the European Space Agency responded...
In early 2016, an artist and
independent researcher named Paul Quast
created a crowdsourced art project known as
A Simple Response to an Elemental Message.
It was similar to previous
initiatives, except, this time,
people were asked to frame their
submissions as an answer to the question,
"How will our present environmental
interactions shape the future?"
As the question implies, the
project was about climate change
and sought to capture a global portrait
of humanity's thoughts and feelings
about the present and
future state of the world.
As explained by Quast
in a few interviews,
the project was intended more as a
time capsule for future generations
than any potential
aliens in outer space.
This is also reflected by the selection
of Polaris as the transmission target.
As mentioned in
a previous chapter,
it's a relatively young and
currently planetless system that's
 highly unlikely to
host life as we know it.
Instead, Polaris was
primarily selected
due to its historical significance
as the famous North Star.
Nevertheless, A Simple
Response to an Elemental Message
received nearly 4 000 submissions
over the course of about eight months.
In addition to the
public messages,
Quast also included a few
copies of the Arecibo Message,
81 quotes by
prominent figures,
and 70 photographs
of Earth and humanity.
All of which was then converted into
binary and finally blasted into space
by the Cebreros Deep Space Ground Station
in central Spain on October 10, 2016.
According to a subsequent
review by Quast,
he found that just under 20%
of the responses were optimistic,
just over 42% expressed
some form of dread or concern,
while the remaining
38% were largely neutral.
In late 2017, a Spanish
music festival known as Sónar
began transmitting brief
snippets of music into space
to commemorate
its 25th anniversary.
Each composition was no
more than 10 seconds in length
and were provided by 38 musicians
with connections to the festival.
The first 18 were transmitted over the
course of three days in October 2017
from a telescope located
in the far north of Norway.
The remaining batch of 20
was then transmitted
over the course of another three
days in May 2018 using the same facility.
What makes this initiative a
bit more interesting, though,
is the fact that all 38 compositions
were preceded by a primer.
In fact, not just one,
but several.
The first one began with two lists of prime
numbers intended to attract attention.
 While the primes were
technically expressed in binary,
it would be more accurate to say that
they're expressed in unary, repeated twice.
So 0-0-1-1 for decimal 2,
0-0-0-1-1-1 for decimal 3,
0-0-0-0-0-1-1-1-1-1
for decimal 5, and so on.
This was followed by a
simple count from 0 to 255
expressed using eight-digit chunks
of binary code, also known as a byte.
So it goes from eight
zeroes representing 0
all the way up to eight
ones representing 255,
the highest value possible
using 8-bit encoding.
Okay, following that introductory
sequence was a second primer
that differed between
the two sessions.
The one included with the first
batch of music was written such that
all 256 bytes represented a
unique number, word, or concept.
These bytes were then used to
convey increasingly complex ideas,
much the same way it's been
done in previous initiatives,
starting with some basic math before
delving into things like physics and sound.
The one included with
the second batch of music
was nearly identical to the one created
by Yvan Dutil and Stéphane Dumas
for Cosmic Call II.
Some of the components
have been shuffled around,
and there's some updated
information about the telescope,
but otherwise, it's
exactly the same.
Immediately following
that was another bitmap
that tried to graphically
convey the concept of a byte
by counting from
0 to 255 once again.
This was then followed
by an image of a sine wave
intended to visually convey
the concept of sound and music.
Now, the target of
these transmissions was
an ancient red dwarf
known as Luyten's Star.
It's a bit more than 12 lightyears
away and harbors two confirmed planets.
The outermost of which, Luyten b,
is about three times the mass of Earth
and orbits within the
star's habitable zone.
In fact, it is one of the nearest
earthlike planets ever discovered,
and it's the sole reason that
this system was targeted.
But as mentioned previously, the
characteristic dimness of red dwarfs
places the habitable
zone very close to the star.
In the case of Luyten b,
it orbits about four times closer
than Mercury orbits the Sun,
takes less than 19 days
to complete a revolution,
and is all but guaranteed
to be tidally locked.
On the plus side, Luyten's Star exhibits
minimal flaring due to its advanced age.
Presuming Luyten b is inhabited
by an advanced civilization,
they'd have about 11 minutes per day
for three consecutive days in early 2030
to pick up the first
batch of music,
with the second arriving
a few months later.
Presuming they do so, we could hear
back from the Luytenians as early as 2042.
Okay, we've finally reached the
most recent interstellar message
as of the making
of this documentary.
Well, kind of.
We'll get to that in a moment.
Following the death of
Stephen Hawking in early 2018,
his ashes were interred at a famous
church in London called Westminster Abbey.
 As the memorial
service came to a close,
an original score set
against Hawking's iconic voice
and written by Greek
composer Vangelis
was simultaneously
beamed into space
from the Cebreros Deep Space
Ground Station on June 15, 2018.
The target was a binary system
nearly five thousand lightyears away
known as V616 Monocerotis.
It's composed of a star with about
one-third the mass of the Sun and...
...a black hole.
At the time, it was the nearest
black hole to the Solar System,
although it has since been dethroned
by at least a few other candidates.
Now, paying tribute
to Stephen Hawking
by beaming his voice into space
may seem like an odd choice,
considering he was a very
outspoken critic of METI.
But as explained
by his daughter Lucy,
the broadcast was a
purely symbolic gesture
intended not only to celebrate
his scientific contributions,
but also to fulfill his lifelong
dream of going into space.
This is further reflected
by the transmission target,
as Hawking dedicated much of
his life to the study of black holes.
Besides, we're hardly gonna
make contact with aliens
in the vicinity of a
black hole, right?
Well, so, about that...
This is a view of
the Solar System
showing all five interstellar spacecraft
that humanity has launched to date.
If we zoom out a bit further,
we can see 23 of the
nearest star systems
targeted by at least one of the radio
transmissions mentioned in this video.
But to see the two most distant targets,
we have to zoom out to a galactic scale.
Here we find V616 Monocerotis, the target
of Stephen Hawking's Memorial Broadcast,
and finally Messier 13, the
target of the Arecibo Message.
But this is by no
means an exhaustive list.
Some radio transmissions,
marked here in grey,
did not make the cut because
they failed to meet one of two criteria
that I made up for this video.
The first one is that a transmission
must be deliberately directed
at an extrasolar target.
After all, the goal of METI is
to contact another intelligence,
so projects that aimlessly
blast messages into space with
no particular target
in mind do not count.
This includes signals that
could accidentally be detected,
like those routinely
transmitted by astronomers to
communicate with spacecraft or map the
surface of bodies within the Solar System.
To give you an example,
in late 1962,
a group of Soviet astronomers
used this absolute beast of a telescope
to bounce radar signals
off the surface of Venus.
For a bit of fun, they decided
to modulate the radar pulses
to spell out the words MIR, LENIN,
and USSR using Morse Code.
This is sometimes described
as the first interstellar message
because a lot of that
radiation went right past Venus
and continued on
into deep space.
Now, if you read
about this online,
you'll find claims that some
portion of that excess radiation
is currently heading for an obscure
binary system known as HD 131336
that's well over a
thousand lightyears away.
The phrasing can often make
it seem as though this was
planned by the original
scientists back in 1962,
but that is not the case.
The true source of this claim
is a forum post from 2002
in which an amateur astronomer did
some quick back-of-the-napkin calculations
to suggest HD 131336 might
have been near the path of the signal
depending on the precise time
of transmission, which is unknown.
Given the imprecision
of that guesstimate
and the fact that the
intended target was Venus,
I decided not to
include it on my list.
The second criterion is that the
strength of a transmitted signal
must be greater
than 100 megawatts.
Now, for any radio astronomers watching,
here I'm not talking about output power,
but the much more crucial parameter,
which is the effective radiated power
that accounts for things like transmission
frequency and gain of the antenna.
For anyone curious, you can find
a spreadsheet in the references
with all the incredibly
exciting technical details.
Anyway, there's nothing
special about 100 megawatts.
I just needed some way to filter
out some of the weaker transmissions
from the stronger ones, and this seemed
like a nice even number to draw that line.
It's neither so high that
everything is excluded
nor so low that
everything is included.
It's just a way to rein in
the scope of this video.
While I tried to be as forgiving
as possible with these two criteria,
you could, of course,
be a lot more strict.
For instance, it is very common
to categorize METI experiments
based on how earnest or frivolous
most experts perceive them to be.
Take the Doritos Broadcast
Project as an example.
It is typically not regarded
as a genuine attempt at METI
because transmitting a commercial into
space is obviously just a publicity stunt.
It's rather silly, unscientific,
and utterly indecipherable.
To use the terminology favored by
Alexander Zaitsev, it's "pseudo-METI".
But as I've stressed multiple
times throughout this video,
what we say isn't
all that important
because we're probably not
going to be understood anyway.
What is important is
that the signal has been
modulated or manipulated
in such a way
that it does not resemble
anything else in the universe.
As long as the recipients are unable
to ascribe the signal to a natural source,
they will have no choice but to entertain
the possibility of intelligent design.
Besides, the distinction between
genuine and pseudo-METI
is highly subjective
and inconsistent.
For instance, the Arecibo Message is
usually upheld as a prime example of METI
despite Frank Drake himself
describing it as a publicity stunt,
and much of it
is indecipherable.
Likewise, the Message to Altair is
typically regarded as genuine METI
even though the Doritos Broadcast Project
was about five times more powerful
and lasted six times longer.
Another approach would be to sort
METI experiments based on the distance to
and habitability of the target.
You could, for instance, exclude
the Arecibo Message because
M13 is extremely far away
and unlikely to be habitable.
Same thing with
Stephen Hawking's Memorial Broadcast
directed at a black hole many
thousands of lightyears away.
But here's where things
get a bit tricky because
how do we determine
when a target is too far away?
In other words, how do we know when
a signal is too weak or sufficiently strong
to be detected by an alien civilization
of which we know nothing about?
The simplest approach would be to assume
the recipients are no more advanced than us
and use our present level of
technology and scientific understanding
as a baseline for detectability.
In other words, if we can't
detect it, neither can they.
If that's the case, they
would definitely struggle
if not be outright
unable to detect
some of the messages
mentioned in this video.
But should we really
make that assumption?
Well, to paraphrase
Carl Sagan,
any civilization even
just slightly behind us
wouldn't be able to
receive or transmit,
whereas any civilization on par
with or billions of years ahead of us
could be.
Odds are they will
be more advanced,
making range and detectability estimates
based on the assumption that they're not
feel rather pointless.
But it feels equally pointless to assume
that they are more advanced because
then it just comes down to who
writes the best science fiction.
Does more advanced mean they have
instruments that are similar to our own
but simply larger
and more sensitive?
Does it mean they have long
since abandoned radio technology
in favor of something
else entirely?
Does it mean they have a more
sophisticated understanding of physics,
and that their technology would
appear to us as nothing short of magic?
Habitability estimates suffer
from a similar problem because
we obviously don't know if
what we regard as habitable
is the same as what
they regard as habitable.
Even if we assume that intelligent
life can exclusively emerge
on earthlike planets
orbiting sunlike stars,
that does not mean
they will stay there.
Perhaps there comes a time
in the lifespan of any civilization
when their energy requirements outpace that
which can be provided by sunlike stars?
Perhaps life is destined to seek
out more extreme environments
that we would never even
think of as being habitable today?
Perhaps the messages we've sent
towards places most unlike our own...
...are the most likely
to receive a response?
All this ambiguity is, of course, a big
reason why many are so opposed to METI
because the unknown
allows us to imagine the worst.
For instance, in early 2010,
Stephen Hawking cautioned against
deliberate communication attempts
out of concern that aliens
might not be too dissimilar
from our past and
present selves.
As we've already seen
throughout this video,
this pessimistic view on humanity
and first contact is very common,
and for good reason.
There are plenty of examples
throughout human history
in which a less
developed society
suffered at the hands
of a more advanced one.
The problem with pessimism,
though, is that it's one-sided.
It would be just as easy to leverage
more positive trends and behaviours
in support of an
optimistic outcome.
For instance, consider this
critique by philosopher Guy Kahane.
Considering how much we've
improved in a very short span of time,
things like child mortality,
homicides, and poverty are declining
while access to clean water, electricity,
and life expectancy are increasing
we only have to look at ourselves to
see how intelligent life might develop
into something we
would want to meet.
Perhaps not humanity of today
since, you know, there's still...
...plenty of room
for improvement.
But if we project these positive trend
lines sufficiently far into the future,
it's possible that much older
civilizations will have long since outgrown
their more
destructive tendencies.
Just as Hawking justified his belief
that aliens will be hostile by saying,
"Look at all the bad
things we've done,"
Frank Drake justified his belief
that aliens will be friendly by saying,
"Look at our
capacity for growth."
Neither argument is more or
less valid than the other because
we're obviously
capable of both.
But as the anti-METI
crowd will often point out,
this uncertainty
is the problem.
They will often argue that the mere
possibility of an existential threat
outweighs any
potential benefits.
To reiterate a quote
from much earlier in the video...
A common counterargument
among those in favor of METI is that
it's too late to worry about
hostile aliens because
we've been leaking radio signals into
space for the better part of a century.
Anyone within about 100 lightyears
of Earth could, in theory,
detect our presence by
intercepting our television broadcasts.
But as opponents of METI
are often quick to point out,
this unintentional leakage is
extremely faint and diffused.
While it's impossible
to say what signals are
too faint for an alien
civilization to detect,
a weaker signal is obviously more
difficult to detect than a stronger one.
But it's not just about signal
strength, it's also about intent.
An archer blindly shooting
arrows in random directions
is a lot less likely
to strike a bullseye
than the archer
aiming for the target.
Sure, radio leakage could
accidentally expose our presence,
but METI goes out of its way
to maximize that outcome.
It's the difference
between a ship lost at sea
that happens to spot the
faint glow of a coastal town...
...and a lighthouse.
There isn't much we
can do about the former
because it's merely a
byproduct of our civilization.
But there's plenty we
could do about the latter,
like, you know,
not build a lighthouse.
While some critics advocate for
precisely that, a planetwide ban on METI,
such proposals are often countered
by what's known as the SETI Paradox.
It goes something like this.
If we conclude that
METI is too risky,
and other civilizations
reach that same conclusion,
what would be the point of
SETI if no one is transmitting?
To quote the man
who coined the term...
The obvious problem with this argument
is the assumption that all civilizations
independently and inevitably
reach the same conclusion.
Even if we decided to
cease transmitting tomorrow,
that doesn't mean all other
civilizations must behave as we do.
In fact, this argument doesn't work
even if METI is universally rejected
because an absence
of deliberate emissions
does not preclude the
detection of unintentional ones,
even if it's a lot less likely.
So the SETI Paradox isn't
much of a paradox at all.
It makes perfect sense to keep listening
even if we never send another message.
But this is just a hypothetical,
of course, because we
probably will send more
messages in the future.
After all, a planetwide ban would
be extremely difficult to enforce,
which is why some critics seek not to
keep quiet but to regulate the noise.
While there's no consensus on what
form such regulation should take,
popular ideas include an
international treaty or policy
that places
restrictions on METI,
some sort of review board
or oversight committee
elected to make decisions
on humanity's behalf,
or a democratic
process where
presumably everyone in
the world gets a vote?
The logistics of which I don't
even dare to think about.
While different policies and
regulations could go a long way
to reduce the number
of transmissions,
they're unlikely to eliminate
the practice entirely.
If people want to do
something badly enough,
there will always
be a way to do it.
Outlaw METI in one country,
and people will go to another.
Make it illegal around the world,
and people will do it in secret.
Hell, I wouldn't be
surprised if a few messages
have been dispatched
in secret already.
Think about it.
Radio telescopes have been
around for well over half a century.
You're telling me not a single
person has had the means and motive
to beam a quick text to Proxima Centauri
when no one else was looking?
I'm not saying it's
common, of course, but...
...not once?
I don't know about that.
As pointed out by evolutionary
biologist Wallace Arthur,
we are, for better or worse, a
species that cannot stand not knowing.
Whether it's the other
side of a mountain,
the other side of an ocean,
or the other side of the galaxy,
the unknown will always
evoke fear in some,
and irresistible
curiosity in others.
No amount of debating
is going to change that.
Now, fortunately for
those of you in camp fear,
METI is extraordinarily
unlikely to succeed.
The stars we've targeted so
far only account for a tiny fraction
of the hundreds of billions
of stars in the galaxy.
Most of which are within just a
few tens of lightyears of Earth
even though the galaxy is
about 100 000 lightyears across.
For one of our
messages to be received,
the Milky Way is either so jam-packed
with communicative civilizations
that it's basically
impossible to miss,
or we would need to be
luckier than the combined luck
of all humans who
have ever lucked...
...and then some.
It's still fun to think
about, of course,
in the same way it's fun to think
about other improbabilities like
winning the lottery.
It could happen,
but it's probably not going to.
So, in my view, it doesn't
really matter either way.
But if I had to pick a side,
I think I'm more persuaded by the
arguments against METI than those in favor.
As much as I would like to have
confirmation that we're not alone,
tying one end of a
rope around your waist
and the other end
around humanity
before sprinting
headfirst into a dark room
hoping there isn't
a hole in the floor
is probably not the
wisest approach.
Thank you for watching.
