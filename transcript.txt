if the acceleration and velocity
have opposite signs
either positive
and negative or
negative and positive
and this example will illustrate that
so this time
we're going to make a table with time
velocity and i'm going to use s
for speed or sp for speed
so at t equals 0
the velocity is positive 24.
and remember speed
is the absolute value of velocity
so the speed is positive 24.
now one second later
what will be the new velocity
well the acceleration is negative six
and recall that if acceleration is
negative the velocity will be decreasing
so it's going to decrease
by six
so 24 minus 6 is 18.
two seconds later it will be
12. three seconds later it's going to be
six four seconds later it's zero
five seconds later it's negative six
and then
so forth
now speed is always positive it's the
absolute value of velocity so here the
speed is positive 18 positive 12
positive 6 0
positive 6 positive 12
and so forth
now let's focus on the first half
in the first four seconds
the object is slowing down
if you look at the speed
the speed is decreasing from 24 to zero
so what's happening is that the object
is moving
but over time
it's moving slower and slower and
slower and so at four seconds
at that instant is not moving however
it's changing direction notice the
velocity it's going from positive to
negative which means that it's changing
from an eastward direction to
a westward direction and it begins to
move faster
towards the west
so as you can see it's speeding up
because the speed is increasing
after four seconds
now remember what we said before
if acceleration and velocity
if they share the same sign
then the object will be speeded up
that is if they're both positive or both
negative
but if they have opposite signs
then the object is slowing down
so during the first four seconds
the velocity is positive and the
acceleration is always negative
therefore because the signs are opposite
it's slowing down the speed is
decreasing from 24 to zero
now
during the second part
of this problem that is after four
seconds
the velocity is negative
and the acceleration is negative
so because they share the same sign
the object is speeding up
as you can see the speed increases from
0 to positive 18 in the next 3 seconds
so make sure you understand that concept
if acceleration and velocity share the
same sign the object is speeded up
if they have opposite signs it's slowing
down
now let's move on to gravitational
acceleration
in physics you'll see this
symbol that looks like a g
and
it's equal to negative 9.8 meters per
second squared
so this is the gravitational
acceleration of planet earth
and it varies
for different planets and other
very large objects
so the gravitational acceleration of the
moon for example
is negative 1.6 meters per second
squared
it's a lot less for one reason the moon
has less mass than the earth
and so
you will weigh a lot less on the moon
you'll feel lighter on the moon
and so you can jump higher on the moon
but let's focus on the gravitational
acceleration of the earth
negative 9.8 what does that mean
well in the last example we saw
what a negative acceleration can do to
velocity
and so the fact that this gravitational
acceleration is negative
means that
it will always decrease the velocity
now the gravitational acceleration of
the earth
it acts in the y direction and not in
the x direction
and so let's talk about velocity
velocity is a vector
and it can have an x component
and it can have a y component
the actual velocity is basically the
hypotenuse of this right triangle
v x is the horizontal component of this
velocity vector
v y is the vertical component
the gravitational acceleration does not
affect v x
it affects v y
so technically you can write this as
g y
it's a vertical gravitational
acceleration it doesn't affect
the horizontal velocity it affects the
vertical velocity so make sure you
understand that
now let's use an example
to help us understand
g y
sometimes it could be written as a y
so a y and g
are basically the same it's negative 9.8
let's say we have a person
who is standing
on top of a cliff
next to the ocean
and this person has
a ball in his hand
and he released the ball from rest
so he doesn't throw it down or throw it
up he simply lets go of the ball
well we know what's going to happen
gravity is going to cause the ball to
fall
now what can you tell me about v y
the vertical velocity of the ball
over time will it become positive or
negative
we know that velocity is speed with
direction
and right now
the ball is going to be moving in the
negative y direction
so this is positive x
this is negative x positive y
negative y it's going down in the
negative y direction
so
v y will become negative
if we make a table
with t and v y
at t equals zero
the initial vertical velocity will be
zero because
the ball was released from rest
now the acceleration
or
also called acceleration due to gravity
is negative 9.8 because it's negative
the vertical velocity will be decreasing
so every second
it's going to decrease by 9.8
so two seconds later it's going to be
negative 19.6
three seconds later it's negative 29.4
now the speed is always going to be
positive
so if you were asked
what is the speed of the ball
let's say three seconds later it's going
to be positive
29.4 meters per second
but if a test question
asks you for let's say the velocity of
the ball three seconds later
you should say it's negative 29.4 meters
per second because it's going in the
negative y direction
and so hopefully
this
number
makes more sense
so the gravitational acceleration tells
you
how fast the vertical velocity is
changing every second
so on the moon
where a g
is negative 1.6
if you were to drop a ball
the vertical velocity will decrease
by 1.6 meters per second
every second
so let's say we have a similar situation
we have the same person
with the ball in his hand
and this time he throws it in the upward
direction
with
an initial speed of 29.4 meters per
second what can you tell me about the
vertical velocity
and its values every second
and let's say this person is still
on the earth
where g
is negative 9.8 meters per second
squared
so even though right now the velocity is
positive
because g is negative
the vertical velocity will decrease
so as the ball goes upward
it's slowing down because the velocity
is positive and the acceleration is
negative because they're opposite in
sign
the ball is slowing down eventually
the ball will reach its maximum height
and then it's going to change direction
and begin to fall down
so if we make a table
between t
and v y
we're going to get the following values
so at t equals 0 that is
initially the vertical velocity is
positive
29.4
now the acceleration tells us
how fast or how much the velocity
changes every second
so one second later it's going to
decrease by 9.8
so 29.4
minus
9.8 will give us
19.6
so one second later it's going to be
positive 19.6
two seconds later we need to decrease
this again by 9.8
so it's going to be positive 9.8
three seconds later it's going to be at
zero
so
when the vertical velocity is at zero
that means that it's no longer going up
anymore and it's not going down yet
it has reached
its maximum height
so it took three seconds
to get to its maximum height
so let's call this
position a position b
and position c
so once he is zero it's at position a
when t is three is that position
uh b
four seconds later
it's going to be negative 9.8
5 seconds later
negative 19.6
6 seconds later negative 29.4 and so
forth
and so once it gets to position b
once it passes that position the
velocity will be negative because it's
now going in the downward direction or
in the negative y direction
so that's the mathematical profile of
this situation
so now you understand what's happening
to the velocity values as time
progresses
so time the acceleration
is negative the velocity is decreasing
as you can see it started with a
positive value
and now
it's becoming negative
now the next topic that
you want to be familiar with is
something called
projectile motion
so what is a projectile
a projectile is basically an object
that is moving under the influence of
gravity
so in the last two examples
the ball that was released from rest and
the ball that was thrown upward
were behaving as projectiles because
once released
they were under the influence of gravity
and in a typical physics course
when dealing with projectile motion
friction is usually ignored
and so we're not going to talk about it
here
so far we've considered one dimensional
projectile motion
that is in the y direction the first
case was a ball going straight down the
second case was the ball going up
and then down
so it's one dimensional because
it's only one direction in this case the
y direction
but let's talk about projectile motion
in two dimensions that is in the x and
in the y direction
so one example that you'll see
is a ball
being kicked off a cliff or rolling off
a cliff
initially it's moving in the x direction
and then it falls down like this
and so
the path
that the ball travels is known as the
trajectory
hopefully i said that right trajectory
but now let's say
the ball was kicked off
the cliff at a speed of let's say five
meters per second
so what can you tell me about the
vertical and horizontal components of
the velocity
of the ball
at different times
so let's make a table between t
v x
and v y
so initially
at when t is zero v x is positive five
because at that instant it's moving only
in the horizontal direction
so if you look at the trajectory
this line is only going to the right
it's not going up or down it's just
going to the right
now
the vertical velocity is zero because
it's not it doesn't have any component
in the y direction
now one second later let's say the ball
is over here
so now the ball is moving in this
direction
so the velocity
can be broken up into its x component so
it's still moving to the right and the y
component it's moving down so let's call
this point a
and at point b
so at point b
because it's going in this direction
it has a v x value and a v y value
and let's say point b
is one second later from point a so
point a t is zero
and at point b t is one
so what is the velocity
at point b
and what is the velocity at point c
let's say where t is 2 2 seconds
one second later
we know what v y is going to be
due to gravitational acceleration
the vertical velocity will decrease by
9.8 every second so two seconds later
it will be negative 19.6 three seconds
later
negative 29.4
now what about vx
now it's important to understand that g
negative 9.8
is
a vertical acceleration not a horizontal
acceleration it's not a y i mean it's
not a x but it's a y
so this number
does not affect the v axe
so when dealing with projectile motion
unless this ball have some rocket
thrusters
vx is constant it doesn't change
so for projectile motion
the acceleration in the horizontal
direction is zero
so unless there's some
some kind of force that's propelling the
ball to the right that is after it's
been kicked
ax is zero
so it's important to keep that in mind
and if a x is zero
that means that v x does not change
if the acceleration is zero the velocity
is not changing the velocity is constant
so to summarize what we've learned here
when dealing with projectile motion
it's important to understand that
the velocity in the x direction v x
is constant it doesn't change
unless the problem states that there's
something accelerating it in a
horizontal direction
if there's no specific statement as such
a x is zero and v x is
constant but for any projectile motion
problem v y changes
v y is going to change by 9.8 every
second
here is another projectile motion
situation
let me start at the bottom so let's say
we have a ball
and the ball is kicked off the ground at
an angle
it goes up and then it goes down
now typically you might be given the
velocity at which is kicked let's say
it's going up at a speed of
40 meters per second
and let's say it's at an angle of 30.
so you have v which is 40
and you have the angle theta which is 30
degrees
now what you need to do is find v x and
v y
v x is basically
v cosine theta
and this is the initial value
v y
is v sine theta
now for this problem i'm going to give
you v x and v y
so we're going to choose some different
values but in a typical problem when
you're given v and theta you can find v
x and v y
by using those formulas
but let's say that
you discover initially the v x is
let's use a nice number eight meters per
second
and v y
we're going to say is
29.4 meters per second
so that's at a time value of zero
what's going to happen one second later
so one second later
what's going to happen to v x and v y
now it's important to understand that
v x will not change for projectile
motion
gravity does not affect vx it affects v
y
so one second later
v x will still be eight meters per
second
v y
is going to decrease by 9.8 meters per
second every second
gravitational acceleration affects v y
but not v x
so this is going to be
19.6
one second later
now two seconds later vx will still be
the same and that's eight meters per
second
v y
is now 9.8
three seconds later
it's at the top
at the maximum height at the highest
point v y is zero so it's not going up
anymore but it's still moving to the
right
so
it's still moving at eight meters per
second
to the right so that's v x
now four seconds later
what do you think is going to happen
well v x is still the same it's still
eight meters per second but now it's
going down
so v y is negative 9.8
and then five seconds later
v x
is still the same
but v y is now
negative 19.6
and six seconds later
v y is going to be
negative 29.4
so notice that the speed
is the same
when the height is the same
if the trajectory is symmetrical
in this case the left side looks exactly
the same as the right side so there's
symmetry for this type of
shape
so at a certain height
v y has the same magnitude but the
opposite side this is positive 19.6 and
that's a negative 19.6
so the velocities just have opposite
signs but speed in either case is still
positive 19.6
so the speed is the same
when the height is the same
but v x doesn't change in the typical
projectile motion problem only v y
changes based on the gravitational
acceleration
now let's talk about newton's three laws
so let's go over the first law
the basic idea behind newton's first law
of motion
is that an object at rest will remain at
rest unless acted on by a force
and an object in motion
will continue in motion
unless acted on by a net force
so let's say if we have a box
and it's at rest it's not moving
the only way we can get this box to move
is by applying
a force
and a force
is a push or pull action
so in this case
the force is pushing the box towards the
right
we can also get the box to move towards
the right if we take a rope
and
pull the rope towards the right
so here this is a push action
and towards the right it's a pull action
and the way to pull something is by
means of a rope
whenever you have a force
acting on a rope
it's known as a tension force
so whenever you hear the word tension
it's basically a force acting through a
rope
so unless we apply a force
the box at rest will continue
to remain at rest
now let's say we have a box
and this box is moving to the right
so it's sliding across the surface
the only way to stop the box
from moving in this direction
is to apply a force in the opposite
direction
and friction will do that too so if you
try to slide a box
across a rough surface
you know the box is going to come to a
stop
because friction
will
oppose
the box for moving friction always
opposes motion it tends to slow things
down
and so thus we have newton's first law
an object in motion will continue in
motion unless acted on by a force
so if there was no friction this box
will continue to slide forever but
because friction is present and it's
opposite to the direction of the
velocity of
the box
it's going to slow it down and bring it
to rest
so if that force wasn't present it will
keep moving
so if you think of objects moving in
outer space where there's almost no
friction
those objects tend to
basically move forever
so if you think of the earth as it
revolves around the sun
the earth moves in a vacuum of space is
basically almost no air in space
and so that there's hardly any friction
thus it can move forever around the sun
without
any
or hardly any assistance
a good way to illustrate this
is imagine if we take an object
and
let's say like a puck if you're playing
air hockey
and if we slide it across ice
because there's not much friction
between this object and ice because ice
has a very smooth surface
this object will travel for a very long
time
because there's not much friction
between the ice and this object
whereas let's say
if you have
the same object across
a rough surface
this object will not slide very far
it's going to come to a stop quickly
because it's more friction
and so if you could reduce friction
the object will travel for a very long
time and if you can completely
eliminate friction
then
by newton's first law of motion it
should continue forever
so an object in motion will continue
emotion
unless
acted on by a force
now let's talk about newton's second law
and the best way to summarize newton's
second law of motion
is through this equation
the net force of an object is equal
to the mass times the acceleration
and sometimes
you'll see
the term net force or in this way
as with a summation
symbol
or sigma
and this could be the net force in the y
direction
or
the net force
in the x direction
nevertheless just make sure you
understand that the net force is
basically the mass times the
acceleration so here's the question for
you let's say
if i have
a 10 kilogram mass
and
it rests across a horizontal surface and
let's say there's no friction
and i apply a force of 80 newtons
what is the acceleration of the box
so f equals m a the force is 80 newtons
the mass is 10 kilograms
what is a
so a is going to be 80 divided by 10
which is 8.
so this box will accelerate
at 8 meters per second squared
so what does that tell us about the
velocity of the box
so every second
the velocity of the box will increase
by eight meters per second
so if we make a table
at t equals zero the velocity is zero
when t is one the velocity is eight when
t is two the velocity is 16
and so forth
and so whenever you apply a force on an
object
you exert an acceleration on that object
and as a result you're increasing the
velocity of the object that object will
begin to move
